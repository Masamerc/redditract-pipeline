/r/announcements/,announcements,Update to Our Content Policy,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/)  we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods  outside organizations  and our own teams  we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First  a quick recap

Since our last post  here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors  clarify our policies  make mods' lives easier  and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays)  including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**  including both our immediate actions (e.g.  today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls  sustainably enforcing the new policies  and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts  it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level  [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/)  measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit)  aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes  chats  modmail)  and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately  it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term  this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities  including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule  along with specific examples  in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic  personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome  but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy  we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits  the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities  about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so  despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1)  antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8)  and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now  we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings  mod changes  quarantining  and more.

Though smaller  r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear  views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith  without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect  with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users  you will always have more context  community vernacular  and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support  you need more support from us as well  and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors  abusive behaviors  and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity  discussions  and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment  with today’s update and those to come  makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback  we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",spez,06-30-2020,False,1593565818.0,False,False,False,40429,82,79,,20671,0
/r/announcements/,announcements,Upcoming changes to our content policy  our board  and where we’re going from here,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate  a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here  and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people  I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being  who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin  and as someone who literally has a platform and  with it  a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week  I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it  many of the responses said something like  “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions  which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart  are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company  and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years  hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users  as mods  and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However  as Reddit has grown  alongside much good  it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily  despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems  and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects  it’s served us well. Under it  we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said  we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do  articulates none of the values behind the rules  and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to  a statement on hate  the context for the rules  and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through  and while we will move quickly  I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement  the timeline is weeks  not months.

And just this morning  Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing)  my Reddit cofounder  announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate  a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long  I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place  where we have made progress  and where  despite our best intentions  we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit  2005–2006  our idealistic “policy” was that  excluding spam  we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested  we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end  we acted based on our beliefs  despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time  in addition to rapid user growth  Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015  my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown  which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment  because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/)  [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/)  [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/)  [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence)  we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves  we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed  both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018  I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules  but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald  a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies  “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit  and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly  we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism  which makes us proud  and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said  this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years  we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter  and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual  but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

/r/announcements/,announcements,Changes to Reddit’s Political Ads Policy,"As the 2020 election approaches  we are updating our [policy on political advertising](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) to better reflect the role Reddit plays in the political conversation and bring high quality political ads to Redditors.

As a reminder  Reddit’s advertising policy already forbids deceptive  untrue  or misleading advertising (political advertisers included). Further  each political ad is manually reviewed for messaging and creative content  we do not accept political ads from advertisers and candidates based outside the United States  and we only allow political ads at the federal level.

That said  beginning today  we will *also* require political advertisers to work directly with our sales team and leave comments “on” for (at least) the first 24 hours of any given campaign. We will strongly encourage political advertisers to use this opportunity to engage directly with users in the comments.

In tandem  we are launching a subreddit dedicated to political ads transparency  which will list all political ad campaigns running on Reddit dating back to January 1  2019. In this community  you will find information on the individual advertiser  their targeting  impressions  and spend on a per-campaign basis. We plan to consistently update this subreddit as new political ads run on Reddit  so we can provide transparency into our political advertisers and the conversation their ad(s) inspires. If you would like to follow along  please subscribe to [r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/) for more information.

We hope this update will give you a chance to engage directly and transparently with political advertisers around important political issues  and provide a line of sight into the campaigns and political organizations seeking your attention. By requiring political advertisers to work closely with the Reddit Sales team  ensuring comments remain enabled for 24 hours  and establishing a political ads transparency subreddit  we believe we can better serve the Reddit ecosystem by spurring important conversation  enabling our users to provide their own feedback on political ads  and better protecting the community from inappropriate political ads  bad actors  and misinformation.

Please see the full updated political ads policy below:

*All political advertisements must be manually approved by Reddit. In order to be approved  the advertiser must be actively working with a Reddit Sales Representative (for more information on the managed sales process  please see “Advertising at Scale”* [*here*](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising)*.) Political advertisers will also be asked to present additional information to verify their identity and/or authorization to place such advertisements.*

*Political advertisements on Reddit include  but are not limited to  the following:*

* *Ads related to campaigns or elections  or that solicit political donations;*
* *Ads that promote voting or voter registration (discouraging voting or voter registration is not allowed);*
* *Ads promoting political merchandise (for example  products featuring a public office holder or candidate  political slogans  etc);*
* *Issue ads or advocacy ads pertaining to topics of potential legislative or political importance or placed by political organizations*

*Advertisements in this category must include clear ""paid for by"" disclosures within the ad copy and/or creative  and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including those promulgated by the Federal Elections Commission. All political advertisements must also have comments enabled for at least the first 24 hours of the ad run. The advertiser is strongly encouraged to engage with Reddit users directly in these comments. The advertisement and any comments must still adhere to Reddit’s* [*Content Policy*](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)*.*

*Please note additionally that information regarding political ad campaigns and their purchasing individuals or entities may be publicly disclosed by Reddit for transparency purposes.*

*Finally  Reddit only accepts political advertisements within the United States  at the federal level. Political advertisements at the state and local level  or outside of the United States are not allowed.*

While we still plan to do that  we think it’s important to acknowledge that this year  things feel quite a bit different. The world is experiencing a moment of incredible uncertainty and stress; and throughout this time  it’s become even more clear how valuable Reddit is to millions of people looking for community  a place to seek and share information  provide support to one another  or simply to escape the reality of our collective ‘new normal.’

Over the past 5 years at Reddit  April Fools’ Day has emerged as a time for us to create and discover new things with our community (that’s all of you). It's also a chance for us to celebrate you. Reddit only succeeds because millions of humans come together each day to make this collective system work. We create a project each April Fools’ Day to say thank you  and think it’s important to continue that tradition this year too.

/r/announcements/,announcements,Introducing Reddit Polls  An All-New Post Type,"If you’re looking for an opinion on anything — the most underrated TV show of the nineties; the very best drugstore mascara; the most athletic NFL player of all-time — there’s no better place to get honest answers and gauge consensus  than on Reddit.

Today  in an effort to elevate Reddit’s diverse opinion-based content  we’re excited to introduce Polls: a brand new post type that encourages redditors to share their opinion via voting. We’ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months  and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited to now release this post type to everyone!

**Why Polls?**

It can sometimes be tough for new redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit    and to feel a sense of community. We believe a simple post type that reduces the posting barrier will make it easier than ever for everyone to contribute to their favorite communities and engage in different ways.

Here’s a look at some of our recent test polls

I’ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**

Hi all 

It’s that time of year again when we share Reddit’s annual transparency report.

We share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit  and how it’s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.

You’ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year  we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically  a breakdown of content policy removals  content manipulation removals  subreddit removals  and subreddit quarantines.

## By the numbers

Since the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long  I’ll call out a few stats below:

**ADMIN REMOVALS**

* In 2019  we removed **\~53M** pieces of content in total  mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating)  exclusive of legal/copyright removals  which we track separately.
* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations  we removed
   * **222k** **pieces of content** 
   * **55.9k accounts**  and
   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).
* Additionally  we quarantined **256 subreddits**.

**LEGAL REMOVALS**

* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content  of which we complied with **37.3%**.
* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018  largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.

**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**

* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.
   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests  mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).
   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.
   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).
* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid  Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)

## While I have your attention...

I’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.

When we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/)  we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms  it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.

Today  we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings  followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.

## If you’ve read this far

In addition to this report  we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit  and if you like posts about what we’re doing  you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity  r/ModNews  r/redditmobile  and r/changelog.

**As usual  I’ll be sticking around to answer your questions in the comments. AMA.**

/r/movies/,movies,What hidden movie gems have you found while browsing Netflix?,I stumbled across 'Look Who's Back' while randomly looking for content on netflix a few months back. The premise is simple: Hitler returns in modern day Germany. The film is a surprising treat in that it's a scripted comedy that explores Hitler's role in mainstream modern media while also infusing real-life interactions with far right-wing people into the film. The ending also has a meta twist and the film has a cynical take on modern day racism and  political leanings. I was pleasantly surprised by this.

/r/IAmA/,IAmA,Why do we lock people up? We’ve spent eight months reporting on stereotypes and misconceptions about the criminal justice system – and now we have a podcast! AUA!,"Hi there. A majority of Americans say they think incarceration should be about rehabilitating offenders. But a majority of Americans also say the justice system is not harsh enough. How do we reconcile these two  often competing  goals? 

We’re reporters who’ve spent eight months producing a podcast that challenges what we think we know about the U.S. criminal justice system. Over six episodes  we take on questions like the one above  as well as: Is it true that most people in American jails have not been convicted of the crime for which they were arrested? Would closing down private prisons really end mass incarceration? And does more immigration really mean more crime? 

We spoke with formerly incarcerated people  reform advocates  a former ICE attorney turned immigration lawyer  crime victims/survivors  researchers. Our goal is to sort out where public opinion and reality don’t align – or  in some cases  where our perceptions contradict each other – when it comes to the criminal justice system. 

The podcast is called [Perception Gaps: Locked Up](https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps/Season-2-Locked-Up) – Season 2 of the [series](https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps) – and we’re all reporters with [The Christian Science Monitor](https://www.csmonitor.com/)  an international (and secular – we know  the name) Pulitzer Prize-winning news organization.

/r/IAmA/,IAmA,I am Kai Strittmatter. I have written a book on China  the mechanisms of dictatorship and digital totalitarianism. Actually it is also a book about us. AMA,"Hej from Copenhagen. My name is Kai. I grew up in a little village in the Bavarian alps  went on to study Chinese and ended up devoting more than half of my life to the study and observation of China  many years as a reporter in Beijing for the German national daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Over the course of more than 30 years I have made invaluable friendships in China  eaten the best food in the world and seen the country change  for the better and for the worse. 
 
The past seven years under the leadership of China’s strong man Xi Jinping have been especially remarkable. Repression and censorship are as strong as they haven’t been for decades  ideology has crept back. At the same time Xi Jinping is reinventing dictatorship with the means of AI and Big Data  he is giving autocratic rule a digital update. All the while China is growing more assertive on the international stage. Competition of systems is back - and it comes at a time when liberal democracy finds itself in the midst of a deep crisis. 

For me this challenge we have to rise up to was the main reason to write my book  We Have Been Harmonized.
 
So go ahead and ask me anything: about the new China  about the new us  about reporting from China  about the best noodles on the planet  why everybody should learn Chinese or why I started working on my book the night when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States.

/r/IAmA/,IAmA,I am Cassie Price  and I help US businesses establish business credit in their business’s EIN without a personal guarantee or credit check and access all kinds of loans and lines of credit.,"Hi Reddit  Cassie from Business Credit Lab  and I’m here today to talk about **1. Building business credit without a personal guarantee or personal credit check and 2. Alternative kinds of lenders for businesses. AMA!**

&#x200B;

Businesses everywhere are struggling  and I'm here to help any way I can.

&#x200B;

I lost nearly everything in the wake of the 2008 crash when my Dad took out a 2 million dollar loan on the farm that had been in our family for over 100 years. I tried everything I could to save the farm and my Dad’s home  but in the end  we couldn’t get funded and lost the farm. My heart broke into a million pieces.

&#x200B;

When I was looking for funding  none of the expensive CPA’s or investment bankers  or attorneys we worked with ever told me about business credit. Credit in the business’s EIN  without a personal guarantee or personal credit check. Business credit could have saved the whole thing  but I had no idea it existed.

&#x200B;

There are also several other ways to fund a business  and no one ever mentioned those either. We call them alternative lending sources and what we mean is an alternative to just going to your bank or the SBA  who are notoriously difficult to get funding from.

&#x200B;

I don’t want anyone else to go through the hell and heartbreak my family and I went through  and now I help businesses both build business credit and find lenders to help them fund their dreams.

&#x200B;

In 2020  my team and I have funded over 30 million dollars in alternative lending and 25 million in real estate funding. We also have lenders for cannabis businesses.

&#x200B;

Most clients building business credit wind up with about 50k in 6 months and 150k in 12 months without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.

&#x200B;

We do all of the following for funding:

&#x200B;

Unsecured business lines of credit  Credit Card Stacking (0% interest credit cards for 6-18 months)  Revenue Lending  Merchant Cash Advances  Account Receivable Financing  Purchase Order Financing  Startup Unsecured Business Financing  Book-of-business Financing  401k Financing  Securities Financing  Commercial Vehicle Financing  Commercial Real Estate  Venture Capital  Private Investment  Equity Investments  Inventory Financing  Equipment Financing  Equipment-Sale-Leaseback  SBA Loans and Prep for expedited applications  Term Loans  Business Lines-of-Credit  House Fix-and-Flip Financing and Buy and Hold.

&#x200B;

Some of these require good personal credit. Others require good cash flow or collateral. But I want people to know they have options  so they don’t make naïve mistakes that compound into loss and foreclosure like I did.

&#x200B;

Unsecured business lines of credit are the easiest and fastest and my favorite but require good personal credit meaning a FICO 8 over 680 and utilization/balances below 40%.

&#x200B;

401k loans are probably my least favorite because why would you risk your actual cash when you probably qualify for other options? I think of them as a last resort but they are great in certain circumstances.

&#x200B;

My options and programs are generally for US-based businesses  but there are sometimes workarounds where I can help you if you're outside the US.

&#x200B;

I also lead a 21-day Bootcamp/challenge where I lead business owners or want to be in business owners through how to establish business credit in their business EIN without a personal guarantee or personal credit check.

&#x200B;

I think all businesses should do this because you never know when you are going to need it or have someone looking at it. For example  the SBA isn’t looking at business credit for the EIDL Covid disaster loans  but many people are having trouble getting funded because the SBA doesn’t know they are a real business. Building business credit helps solve this problem  not because of the funds you get but because the process of building business credit puts your information out correctly on the internet and makes you verifiable.

\*\*In no particular order  I love helping people figure out how to hack their personal credit scores  stack different types of funding  get out of dead-end jobs  skip Shark Tank or investors (to keep all their profit)  fund their dream business  and grow existing businesses.\*\*

/r/IAmA/,IAmA,I'm Sarah  a Professor at The University of Manchester. I'm using my astrophysics research background to identify ways to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions... from food. Ask me Anything!,"EDIT 2PM: This AMA is now closed - thank you so much for all your fantastic questions! 



Hi Reddit  Sarah here! I have been studying dark matter and dark energy for the last 20 years  but when my kids started school I started to think about our own planet in the next 20 years and beyond. I learned about climate change properly for the first time  how it threatens worldwide food production  and how food causes about a quarter of all global warming. I wanted to know how much each of my food choices was contributing  and why. Did you know  if we stopped burning fossil fuels  food would be the biggest contributor to climate change?

I delved into the academic research literature  and summarized the results in simple charts. The charts make it easy for the non-specialist to see the impacts of different meal options  and show that some easy food switches can reduce food greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent. Most of us make many food choices every day  and by changing these we can significantly reduce climate change caused by food  and free up land that can be used to help reduce climate change overall.

There is an impending perfect storm of pressure on our food production system  with increasing population and changing consumer tastes  in the face of rising temperatures and extreme weather events. Tim Gore  head of food policy and climate change for Oxfam  said “The main way that most people will experience climate change is through the impact on food: the food they eat  the price they pay for it  and the availability and choice that they have.”. Yet  at the same time  food production causes about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions  and this is rising as the population increases and becomes more affluent.

As far as I know neurotransmitters are only released  bound to receptors and reuptaken in the synpatic cleft. I that is the case  then what's the point of multiple neurotransmitter types if chemical signal is going to only be translated into a binary electric signal that is 1 (excitation of the membrane)  while none is 0 (resting membrane potential)? For me  in my limited knowledge  it appears as if their existance is useless since electrical signals alone or just a single neutrotransmitter type would suffice  unless neurotransmitters were released into the intracellural space and all neurons in an area of the brain with specific receptors would pick them up  which isn't a case in models I can find on the internet or in books.

/r/Jokes/,Jokes,One day a man decided to retire. He booked himself on a Caribbean cruise and proceeded to have the time of his life  that is  until the ship sank...,"

He soon found himself on an island with no other people  no supplies  nothing  only bananas and coconuts.

After about four months  he is lying on the beach one day when the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to the shore.

In disbelief  he asks  ""Where did you come from? How did you get here?""

She replies  ""I rowed over from the other side of the island where I landed when my cruise ship sank.""

""Amazing "" he notes. ""You were really lucky to have a row boat wash up with you.""

""Oh  this thing?"" explains the woman. "" I made the boat out of some raw material I found on the island. The oars were whittled from gum tree branches. I wove the bottom from palm tree branches  and the sides and stern came from an Eucalyptus tree.""

""But  where did you get the tools?""

""Oh  that was no problem "" replied the woman. "" On the south side of the island  a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock is exposed. I found that if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln  it melted into ductile iron and I used that to make tools and used the tools to make the hardware.""

The guy is stunned.

""Let's row over to my place "" she says ""and I'll give you a tour."" So  after a short time of rowing  she soon docks the boat at a small wharf. As the man looks to shore  he nearly falls off the boat.

Before him is a long stone walk leading to a cabin and tree house.

While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope  the man can only stare ahead  dumb struck.

As they walk into the house  she says casually  ""It's not much  but I call it home. Please sit down.""
""Would you like a drink?""

""No! No thank you "" the man blurts out  still dazed. ""I can't take another drop of coconut juice.""

""Oh  it's not coconut juice "" winks the woman. ""I have a still. How would you like a Tropical Spritz?""

Trying to hide his continued amazement  the man accepts  and they sit down on her couch to talk. After they exchange their individual survival stories  the woman announces 

"" I'm going to slip into something more comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave? There's a razor in the bathroom cabinet upstairs.

No longer questioning anything  the man goes upstairs into the bathroom. There  in the cabinet is a razor made from a piece of tortoise bone. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened on to its end inside a swivel mechanism.

""This woman is amazing "" he muses. ""What's next?""

When he returns  she greets him wearing nothing but some small flowers on tiny vines  each strategically positioned  she smelled faintly of gardenias. She then beckons for him to sit down next to her.

""Tell me "" she begins suggestively  slithering closer to him  ""We've both been out here for many months. You must have been lonely. When was the last time you played around? She stares into his eyes.

He can't believe what he's hearing. ""You mean..."" he swallows excitedly as tears start to form in his eyes

There's so many books out there! And I know the obvious answer is: ""Shut up  read your books and enjoy them""  the fact is that  if I read them at my own pace  I'll read significantly less in my life (during the years my reading ability stayed more or less the same).

Because it being a “classic” literature  I always imagined it’d be closer to a work of art- that is dense  deep  and not at all fun to read.

Faust 1 was amazing and much easier than I had originally anticipated (though I probably missed out a lot on the lyricism & subtlety) For the first time in my life I finished an entire book within a day. 

I’m currently reading the 2nd part of Faust  and with limited knowledge of greek mythology & European history  it hasn’t been such an easy reading even with the annotations. However  I still find myself enjoying it  which is something that rarely happened while reading books.

I love how long the dialogue is and I love how Salinger describes each member of the Glass family! Like they're so damn vivid in my head  especially Zooey. What a perfect  charming asshole (I say this lovingly). I was really iffy about him when he was first introduced since the impression I got from Buddy's letter was that he was a nice guy with strong opinions. I was right about the strong opinions part  but he's not really a nice guy. >!But damn that part when he called the house phone to talk to Franny  it was so damn endearing even if I'm still not sure what his goal was by doing it. Can someone explain that part for me? The analyses I see online are a bit hard to understand.!<

I think another reason why I loved it so much was that I saw a lot myself in Franny. Like a lot  from the questions about religion to the way she cried in the bathroom in that one part  and I'm the youngest kid in the family. Also a girl.

My family also has a lot of parallels with the Glass family. >!I've lost two of my older brothers  the eldest and the fourth-eldest  like Seymour and Walt  respectively. The Glass siblings consist of two girls and three boys  my family has two boys and three girls excluding myself (I'm definitely nitpicking here).  I've had that experience of being berated by my older brother for half an hour to the point of uncontrollable sobbing  and this particular brother is the second-youngest  just like Zooey. And I was going through something vaguely similar to Franny's situation  in which I stopped going to school for a few months because of mental health issues. There's this one part in Zooey's speech to Franny that was exactly like what my brother said. You can imagine my shock there when I read it. !<

It definitely felt like the book was speaking to me  which is why I liked it/was creeped out so much. But I don't know  what do you think? I need to hear the parts that people didn't like  I'm 95% sure that I'm blind to the flaws because of my bias.

/r/books/,books,"Do you think Aldous Huxley's ""Island"" is really his idea of a utopia?","A few possibilities:  Do you think he really thought Pala would be an ideal society?

I've seen many people imply that Pala is Huxley's idea of a utopia to counter the dystopia he illustrated in Brave New World  but it seems like there must be more intricacy to it than that. The societal developments he outlined were likely novel ideas at the time  but have become cliche in the years since (much as he presciently predicted much of modern society's ills in Brave New World).

Sometimes your battery might be under a lot of stress running towards the last percentages of its full capacity while charging.

Battery limiter is a simple  small software that will help you and alarm you when charge capacity hits the limit. So you'll never forget to unplug your laptop again. The default limit set is 90% but you can modify this up to 96% max. Once the alarm starts all you have to do is unplug your laptop to stop it. Battery limiter will keep your laptop away from sleep mode while running so you don't miss the alarm.

/r/blog/,blog,New “Start Chatting” feature on Reddit,"Hi everyone 

We wanted to give you a heads up about a new feature that we are launching this week called “Start Chatting.” This past month  as people around the world have been at home under various shelter-in-place restrictions  redditors have been using chat at phenomenal new levels. Whether it’s about topics related to COVID-19  local news  or just their favorite games and hobbies  people all around the world are looking for others to talk to. Since Reddit is in a unique position to help in this situation  we’ve created a new tool that makes it easier to find other people who want to talk about the same things you do.

Redditors can visit a community and click on the ‘Start Chatting’ prompt  which will then match them with other members of that community in a small group chat. In our testing  we’ve already seen some interesting use cases for Start Chatting  such as meeting new people within conversation-oriented communities  discussing cliffhangers from the latest episode in our TV show communities  or finding others to game with online. We’re excited to see other use cases emerge as more and more redditors get access to this feature.

&#x200B;

[A Mobile View of r\/AnimalCrossing with the Start Chatting Prompt](https://preview.redd.it/9091p8607sv41.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=647c1330f8b3fb8587e3c084f54203465658fa25)

Start Chatting begins rolling out today and will become available to even more communities in the coming weeks.

For more information  please refer to the [Start Chatting Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/chat/start-chatting) that answers common questions about the feature and has details on how to report abuse.

Let us know if you have any questions or feedback!

/r/blog/,blog,Reddit in 2019,"It’s December  which means it's that time of the year to cue up the ""Imagine "" overpromise and underdeliver on some fresh resolutions  and look back (a little early  I know) at a few of the moments that defined Reddit in 2019.

You can check out all the highlights—including a breakdown of the top posts and communities by category—in our official [2019 Year in Review blog post](https://redditblog.com/2019/12/04/reddits-2019-year-in-review/) (or read on for a quick summary below).

In the meantime  Happy Snoo Year from all of us at Reddit HQ!

/r/blog/,blog,Just Launched: Easily Share Reddit Posts Directly to your Snapchat Story!,"We’re excited to announce our new integration with Snapchat  which enables Reddit iOS users to seamlessly share their favorite Reddit content with friends in the Snapchat app.

**How To Share**

Redditors who have the Snapchat app installed will be able to share their favorite Reddit posts with friends in a Snap! To share Reddit content in Snapchat  redditors simply tap the “share” icon on any post on Reddit's iOS app and select the Snapchat option. Then add it to your Story so all your friends can see it or choose a few friends to send the post to.

**The Experience For Viewers**

Snapchatters will see unique Reddit content in their Snaps and Snap Stories via a new sticker designed specifically for the integration  which includes Reddit logo and source information. If the Reddit mobile app is installed  the viewer can simply swipe up on the Snap to visit the original post in the Reddit mobile app. If the viewer does not have the Reddit app installed  they will be taken to the App Store to download Reddit on iOS upon swiping up on the Snap.

This feature is a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and help newer redditors discover more communities. We also announced a community contest to see which redditors could create the best Custom Feed for a variety of categories. Today  we’re here to announce the winners and ~~give them a few scraps of Silver~~ shower them in Premium.

# First  a few highlights

Since we announced the update  we’ve already seen:

* Over **300 000 custom feeds** have been created
* Over **10 000** of you have **followed another redditor’s feed**
* The **most followed feed** has a variety of “Hold My \_\_\_” subbies and was created by u/waldrich. Naturally  it’s called [**/holdmyshit**](https://www.reddit.com/user/wardrich/m/holdmyshit/)
* The **second most followed** feed is your one-stop spot for all of the NBA teams’ subreddits. It’s succinctly named [**All NBA**](https://www.reddit.com/user/8unk/m/feed_me/) and is by u/8unk.

# Now on Android

Custom Feeds are ready to go for Android! It’s part of version 3.31  which shipped on July 15th. Android redditors: you can now create and edit your Custom Feeds  plus follow your favorite feeds. (Before this update  you could only consume existing Custom Feeds.)

/r/television/,television,The constantly changing tone of Lovecraft Country is awesome.,"Every episode is nothing alike  the variety between them is amazing.

In the most recent episode  it really felt like an Indiana Jones movie. 

In the previous episode  it was a ghost movie.

You get the idea.

I’ve seen some people not like the constantly changing focus it has  but I think it’s great. They tell an entire story every episode. A beginning  middle  end  then move onto the next chapter in its story  all within the span of a episode. 

They don’t fuck the audience around and put annoying cliffhangers at the end of their episodes to make us groan and hook us in for the next week. The end of the episode either finishes the story  or finishes the story AND sets up the next. 

It’s really great and refreshing. I highly recommend you check the show out if you haven’t. 

It’s up there with Watchmen and if it keeps up the quality work  will fill in the hole Watchmen left behind. At least for me.

/r/GetMotivated/,GetMotivated,[Article] Building any venture from the ground up takes a ton of discipline and then some,"For the past year  I’ve been creating videos online and growing an audience through that. And then  last week  my channel hit 1000 subscribers. This was a goal that seemed kind of unattainable a few months ago. While this is a small milestone and there’s plenty of growth left to take place  I think there are a few key things that I’ve learned along the way… and these are things that can be applied to starting any venture from the ground up.

1. Set a goal that you can control
2. Aim for Consistency
3. Be open to making sacrifices
4. Identify what you enjoy about the process
5. Pay attention to the market (or audience)
6. Have Patience

There are certainly many other values and practices that matter  but these were the most pivotal to my growth online. I expect these keys to be applicable for any other entrepreneurial venture as well  and leaning into these practices will allow you to start from a stronger place. I discuss this in depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVZzBUaOUDU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVZzBUaOUDU).

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by sneaking a local mega club into my pants," Today I fucked up by sneaking a local mega club into my pants. Nothing saved me  not even the fact that I had been drinking all night and it wasn't long before I passed out in the bathroom of this place. The place was smaller now that it was in my pants  but let's start with the start  it started at 7PM  I took my bike to a walk around town and then went back home. When I got there  I saw some guy who looked like he worked here coming out of the club. He didn't seem very talkative  but I was just walking inside to see what was happening when the guy who brought me here approached me. ""You?! you what you? you big? big you? big? yes?"" he said with a heavy accent  I didn't catch it  but apparently he was very surprised to see me because I had to repeat myself twice saying ""I am just  walk  walking yes  with biky  bike good or somethimg  you know these kind of stuff"" and he immediately fell in love because he knew I was just a tourist and thought I was trying to pick his pocket. Guess he never heard about pick pocket mobs being hunted by the gnomes and their technology. I myself a lot of tall  so this is why he must have thought I am not from their culture  I live here  and there are no flights at all because we live in a global pandemic stuff. so nevermind I went to the more outside of the club-like building and waited until closing time. but my watch was broken  it was a gift from my mom before she died  I missed the last train so I started drinking from the nearby bar and then went to sleep in the bathroom  where I woke up at noon the next day with a club in my pocket. I tried taking it out  but it was stuck. I opened the door and started complaining about it  but the bartender told me he had already closed the place down and everyone had left. and I couldn't see the club next door for life since yesterday before this day when in happned (last week) but the bartender said it was still open  I couldn't care less and went to sleep with the idea of taking a train back home.

So yesterday was a very ordinary Saturday for me I woke up spend some time with my friends. They went out at one point  after I was left alone I decided to finish my food from yesterday  and this is where the fun begins I smell the food and I acknowledge the fact that is spoiled but say to myself it won’t be a big deal if I eat it anyway. I dig in and eat it accompanied with some substantial amount of chili sause and yogurt. 
Fast forward an hour or so I start sweating and getting out of air with my stomach in pain. I decide to return home and deal with it there   jump up on a train I feel worse and worse by the minute. I got out on a random station  there I saw a sign that directs to a toilet I follow said signs but halfway trough I barf two times on the tracks. I continue down some stairs later and eventually sees the toilet. But unfortunately it was out of order and closed. Then I proceed to vomit next to the toilet  felt like shit for the next couple of hours.

/r/tifu/,tifu,Tifu by accidentally tasting my own shit and vomiting explosively all over my wife and tiny flat.,"This actually happened yesterday and not today but I need to tell someone. Sorry if my grammar is bad  English isn't my first language.


A couple of years ago my wife watched a video in which someone played a joke where they put chocolate on someone's bum when they slept so in the morning it looks like they shat themselves. She found it so funny that she's done it to me every couple of months. I'm sure you can see where this is going.

This week we have finiahed moving country and changing jobs  it has been crazy busy for both of us so we haven't taken the time to cook. Through lack of sleep and bad eating for a week my stomach hasn't been the most cooperative.

This is where my FU begins  last night was curry night with work and being my first week I didn't want to refuse  I don't normally eat spicy food but I thought ""what's the worst that could happen? I don't want to start the new job being the unsociable one"". After the curry I came home and went straight to bed (my tummy was fine) while my wife was still doing paperwork/playing games or something in the house. 

Fast forward to the morning  my wife was still asleep when I woke up so I was alone with my thoughts. Pretty quickly I notice something wet and sticky around my bum  like I said before she has played the prank a lot before so I don't find it weird that there is a wet feeling. As she wakes up I say something like ""oh no! I've pooped the bed  whoopsie doodle"". 

This is the moment that sealed the deal. She says something along the lines of ""better taste it to make sure"". So I reach down under the blankets and get some bum candy on my finger and pull it out. My wife looks visibly confused and expresses concern but I thought it was part of the joke. 

I put my finger in my mouth  my wife's face drops  I immediately recoil  gag  sit up and try and get the shit out of my mouth  within seconds I can't hold It and vomit starts exploding from my mouth like a fully pumped super soaker. Now the blankets have moved the spicy shit smell is abundantly clear and the curried shit is mixing with the curry vomit to create a putrid death mix. I can't stop vomiting and now my wife is crying running around looking for a bucket.

It spilled everywhere  it covered the bed  covered the brand new carpets in the bedroom  I'm pretty sure the smell could have eroded the walls. After a few minutes the vomiting stops  we are both crying but at least I have a bucket. Now the cleanup begins  I shit you not it taken 3 hours to clean everything. Thank god I didn't have to work this weekend. I am currently sat next to my wife watching terminator in silence and we are both still traumatised  I'm sure in a few months we can laugh about it but for now we have to live in a 'shitty' flat that has a subtle deathly aroma.

TL: DR I thought my wife played a prank on me but she didn't and I ended up tasting my own shit  continued to vomit explosively over my wife and bedroom ruining the carpets.",passionatePig,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,10,0,0,,20,0
/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by ruining my friends 18th birthday,"This happened earlier this morning and my brain still hasn't fully taken in what's happened  so schools starting back up and one friend has a birthday at the beginning of September but as I go to bed late (like 2 or 3 in the morning) I don't acknowledge the date until I wake up later in the day. My friend messaged me saying hello and I was confused because we had had an argument about a week ago and so I had blocked her (I didn't feel like talking after what she had said and I later had an argument with another friend about similar things and just didn't want to be friends anymore). 

She continues to message me and I'm telling her I didn't want to talk to her anymore and she seems really upset  she then says ""it's my birthday today"" and in my head I'm thinking this is just the wrong day for this and I should have left the conversation there (I can be very rude at times because sometimes I have almost no filter in what I say)  I was still kinda mad at her though so I just kept telling her I just didn't want to continue talking and she should just go to bed. The conversation starting getting more rude on both our parts and from the messages we both seemed really upset but for different reasons  finally the conversation ended about 3 and I know she was gonna wake up early to celebrate her birthday with family and her other friends and probably have a great day if she isn't too tired or upset over what was said.

/r/tifu/,tifu,Tifu by getting caught masturbating  therefore cracking my 500 dollar monitor screen bought as a gift by my grandma  dad doesn’t know yet? Or...,"Just hear me out

I finally built my pc last week and along with it came a 500 dollar dual omen monitor. Moving along  I’m watching YouTube for a couple of hours right before bed and the urge seizes me  so I whip out the meat and and have my normal wank. 

Keep in mind  I’m hyper-precautious about getting caught and I have about perfected my strategy  so I treated this session like any other. 

Door is locked  parents are supposed to be asleep  headphones on 1 ear  chair turned away from the door  finger always ready to press esc just in case  and dad never unlocks my door... are all the things I had in mind when entering into this beat-session. Not an iota of me was concerned about the possibility of anything going erratic.

*Sigh*  with my shorts and underwear laying adjacent to the chair and the porn displayed on full screen on the monitor  I hear the door unlock. Instead of immediately pressing escape  however  a panic combined with confusion literally prevented my brain from fully processing what had just occurred  so I froze like a fucking idiot without turning around to see if he was watching. 

So given all the possible things I could have done in this situation  my fight or flight instincts apparently didn’t have my best interest— they decided that I since I didn’t press escape in time  I should probably throw the new and expensive monitor on the ground while simultaneously falling onto my stomach so I could somehow maneuver my shorts over the legs. 

As I recall this all happened in under 5 seconds.

What just happened was so unexpected and horrifying that I actually thought I was hallucinating or half asleep (this was 2 am). Immediately after I looked back and forth at the monitor which was lying face down and to the previously locked door which was now 2 inches open for a solid minute  trying to decipher whether my father had really just witnessed all of this. 

As if this night could pan out even worse  i finally mustered up the courage to continue with life  so with a heartbeat of about 200 and my legs wobbling out of pure shock  I picked up my monitor unsuspectingly to delete the porn...and that’s when my day truly turned into something nightmarish: the glass of my monitor had been completely shattered. 

At this point  all the terrible emotions I had ceased entirely. There are some moments so bad in life that the only thing that you can do is go completely numb. Maybe a defense mechanism to protect myself from literally roping. But from there  I kid you not  I relocked my door  replugged everything back into the pc and monitor which somehow still worked and the porn video  and busted the without a doubt the most shameful and depressing nut that has ever left my body. I think I’m a psychopath.

Now  I cannot entirely prove that my dad (possibly mom but she’s never been awake this late) actually saw the porn. I can  however  reach a very justified conclusion based on the fact someone opened locked the door. What I think happened is that my dad unlocked the door  quickly looked into my room for whatever reason  darted out of the room right when he saw the porn  and that’s when I threw the monitor. Even more suspicious was that the crashing of the monitor was extremely loud  but whoever was outside my room didn’t check on me  so that leads me to believe my dad knew the noise was due to the fact he walked in on me so he didn’t go in to check on me because he knew that i was also aware that he walked in on me  so it wouldn’t been two awkward if he’d came in.

Over-analyzing this? Maybe. Is this actually a pretty complicated situation? Yes  for many reasons. Am I screwed tomorrow no matter what? You bet your ass. 

Lastly  I want to state my thoughts on the two possible outcomes. 1  somehow my dad really did unlock the door  but didn’t see I was watching porn. I freaked out for no real reason  and he was listening to music so he didn’t hear the crashing monitor. So I tell him that I was fixing the monitor when it fell off of my desk and it shattered; He’s pissed but more importantly he didn’t catch me masturbating. Or 2  the situation I’m deeply dreading but is most likely the case. My dad actually caught me watching porn while jacking-off  darted out of my room before I could see him  heard the monitor crash but didn’t check because it would’ve been too awkward for him to come back in and now regardless I have to go with the story that it was an accident. The kicker  though  is that he will truly know what happened and will know that the accident story is all a lie  and we will buy a new monitor based on the lie  never stating but forever both implicitly knowing the reason why I’m replacing the monitor that his 85 year grandma bought for me expecting me to use it for homework purposes only. 

TL;DR React however you feel like to this nightmare  but I would appreciate some level of advice because I am truly worried about tomorrow...really fucking appreciate if you read the whole thing  peace out.",alrightythen1234567,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,3,0,0,,3,0
/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by revealing my cock length to my family,"Alright  so here’s the dealio.

I have a large Italian family with many cousins  uncles  aunts  nephews  et cetera. Every once in awhile we’ll all gather up to celebrate the anniversary of our great grandparents’ wedding  a special occasion marking the creation of our family. They’re long gone now  but it’s the memory that counts  and we celebrate by cooking a feast for the ages  rivaling thanksgiving dinner.

Now upon the eve of this anniversary all “da boys” (as us men in the family affectionately call ourselves) gather up and go to a famous local bar in downtown Boston. They only accept cash  very “old school” feel to the place  but it makes for some great stories. Usually the place is a blast  with all sorts of banter and drunken shenanigans occurring  but not last night...

Now before I divulge the details  I ought to give some background as to how I fit into this family. Where my father and I are well integrated into the family  my mother is quite the outsider. She comes from wealthier  southern origins  around the mid-Atlantic part of the country. Because of this  she’s always viewed the family as “working class”  with her posh accent sticking out like a sore thumb at gatherings of Bostonians. By extension  I’ve always felt I had to prove to my family that I can “hang” with them so to speak  and in a way I worry that they see my mom as the woman who pulled my dad away from their tight knit circle. 

Now let’s cut back to last night at the bar. Laughs  drinks  and stories all around the bar as we enjoy ourselves. My cousin Vinny invites me and some of the younger guys to play truth or drink. At this point I’m already quite drunk  but accept for the fun of it. A few questions in and Vinny asks me “how big is your dick? I know you’re packing a huge one Anon  right?” 

Of course my other cousins all groan with embarrassment  but I foolishly answer instantly  unaware of the ramifications of my response. 

“4.5 inches” I say too confidently  and suddenly all eyes are on me.

“Drink anon  I know you’re bullshitting me man!” says Vinny  with a twinge of nervous angst in his voice. 

“I’m serious Vin  that’s all I got  haha”

Dead silence. I gaze across the bar to see my entire family looking in shock and awe at my response. Vinny attempts to get everyone focused back on the game  and everyone resumes at a quieter tempo  but I knew that I had just majorly fucked up.

After leaving the bar  my uncle Paul pulls me aside  puts both hands on my shoulder and says “Kid  please tell me you’re just fucking around about your cock size”

“No paul  Jesus what the fuck is your problem?” I say indignantly

“Anon  don’t you know everyone in this family is packing fat schlong? For Christ sakes I’m on the smaller side and still clock out around 7 inches.”

“So what? Why the hell does penis size matter to you so much?” I’m starting to get worried at this point  I’ve never seen Paul look at me with such intensity.

“Matter to me? It’s matters to the whole damn family! Cock size is more than a number  it quantifies your entire personality. You can’t call yourself a member of this family if your walking around with a fucking baby carrot between your legs”

Paul went on explaining the history of this family  and how the men found success through leveraging their superior cocks  both literally and figuratively. According to him  my dad was somewhat of a legend  with a massive 10 inch meat cannon. Apparently during a final 200 meter dash in highschool  my father won by enlarging his penis so much and preformed a pelvic to win the race. I always felt like I never lived up to my father’s athletic record  but now I know that I come short in more ways than one.

So how could my dad’s cock be so big  and mine be so small? I had to investigate.

It turns that penis endowment correlates with genes on both the X and Y chromosomes  meaning that both my mother and father’s genetics are responsible. My father’s side obviously is known for their legendary sausages  so I knew I had to speak with my mother.

She was incredibly reluctant to describe her male family members’ genitalia to me for some reason... odd. I knew I had to investigate further  so I called some of my cousins and uncles from that side. Turns out  the family has relatively average penis sizes  but all larger than mine. Combined they averaged about 6 inches.

Here’s what makes no sense  if my dad’s side has an average of 8 inches  and my mom’s side has an average of 6 inches  why don’t I fall within that range?
I suspected my mother’s hesitancy to speak on the matter indicated a darker secret  so I went digging.

My mom was friends with a man she knew from law school named Brian  and I always suspected she might have had a thing for him. I reach out to talk  and he gladly accepts.

Over the phone  I ask him “So how big is your cock?”

“My cock? Ahh  unfortunately I was born with a rather small 3 inch cock  but it gets the job done. It’s about average in my family”

Bingo  what lies in between 3 and 6? 4.5. Brian was my father. But before I had a chance to ask him  the phone line disconnected. 

My father stands across from me  holding the phone cord in his hand. He had been on the other line  and must have figured it out.

“I always knew...” he said with a solemn look in his eye. He sulked away and retreated to his room  feeling unworthy to face the rest of the family.

I realize now that I needed to at least make amends with my cousins  they might not be able to respect my cock on size  but maybe I could demonstrate the skill and speed of my cock.

The dinner party was about to start  my mother and father had clearly been arguing and didn’t show up. Nobody bothered to look at me  and when they did catch my eyes I only saw disdain.

I realized now was the chance  and stood up on the table.

“I challenge anybody who’s man enough to a sword fight!” I declared  whipping my smaller cock out into the air for everyone to see.

At first I was met with silence  but then Vinny steps up  with rage in his eyes...

“Tough talk for a fella with a small cock”

He joined me on the table  summoning is terrifying 9 inch meat penetrator. I quickly assumed a guard position  I was 5 inches short from a fair fight  so I had to play defensively.

He charged with his penis in hand  swinging wildly  but clearly underestimating my maneuverability. I dodged and landed 3 quick jabs with the tip of my peen on his shaft. He reposted quickly  but I chambered his advanced and managed to strike at the balls. Vinny was down  but soon the rest of the family whipped out their cocks and prepared to engage in an all out melee. 

The smell of musty dicks filled the air as men took their sides on the battlefield. Some came to defend me  admiring my valor in single combat with Vinny  while others came to avenge him. Soon a frontline emerged  reminiscent of the pike-and-shot warfare of the early modern period. Men on the front pushed and pulled with their cocks to make ground  while occasionally allowing for volleys of cum to fly across the room as artillery.

The battle was intense  casualties began to stack up  and it looked like my side was going to collapse.

Then my father came downstairs  10 inch cock in hand.

“You may not be my son  anon  but you’ll always be my boy” 

He and my allies charged  rallying our fallen comrades. I’d never seen a man cockfight like my father before. He used his massive schlong like a zweihander  cutting down two  three cocks at once.

Soon the battle ended  with Vinny’s allies surrendering in defeat. The room was covered in ball sweat and cum  dripping from the walls and ceiling. 

I don’t know where I stand with the family currently. Many have learned to accept me  but I’m sure it will take years before the rest consider it. Who knows how many more wars this family will fight before peace is had... and it’s all my fault.

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by watching anime with my younger brother,"We all know anime has their moments of mature content  especially the ones that weren't made for kids. So while the anime Jojo's Bizzare Adventure JJBA has always been in my 'to watch' list  it was my SO that really pushed me to watching it. I started from part 3 onwards and quarantine has finally given me enough time on my hands to watch parts 1 and 2  but with so much more time  I got to rewatching the whole 5 animations. 

Now  we don't skip the intro because my brother and I have always enjoyed watching it and singing along sometimes but we don't pay much attention to the ending song. Fast forward to part 5. The ending song is in English and my brother heard the lyrics where the 2nd line of it was 'it makes me so horny'. 

Now my brother  who is 9 by the way  is asking me what 'horny' means. 

I especially don't pay attention to the ending  and at first I didn't believe him. So now I 'accidentally' press the mute button when the ending starts or pretend I didn't hear it. 

Regardless... I just hope he doesn't accidentally use the word in front of my parents thinking it's a Jojo reference because he's been doing all sorts of references lately since we watched them together. I haven't told him what it means yet and I hope I'll get away with playing stupid about it.

Since March  we haven't seen each other because of the worldwide pandemic. We had no means of communication  started feeling insecure. I missed her alot. Last week  the ministry of health said we could go to church again but with guidelines. I as a believer in Christ went and when I was about to leave I saw my girlfriend with another boy.

This one actually happened today. Ok it is 1:30AM at the moment and this occurred about 9 hours ago...so  yesterday? Anyways...

 I have had an issue with my right knee for about 3 years after a fall on the job. Most of the time it is just a dull ache and I can go about my life relatively normally. Every once in a while though it feels like a knife is wedged on top of my shin and under my kneecap. X-rays showed nothing and physical therapy hit a wall after a few months.

 My primary had scheduled me for a CT back in March  but the pandemic nixed that. Well  last Tuesday I had the scan and then got the results and did the teledoc thing with the specialist. He pulled up my scan to show me the findings and it was basically a 3D rendition (like CAD) of my leg from mid thigh to mid shin. Muscle tissue in great detail  nerves  ligaments  and bone. As helps zooming in through the muscle to the tendons I let slip a comment that will haunt me.

I was looking at my lower quadriceps and the detail when I said  without thinking. ""That is some fine marbling."" I made it sound like I was picking out some steaks or something for the grill. The specialist paused  but remained professional and went right back to discussing my knee. I was so ashamed of what I said i missed some of the finer points  but essentially I smashed the crap out of my patellar tendon (tendon that holds the kneecap in place) where it meets the top of my tibia (shin bone). It is about an inch wider than it should be. Good news is no surgery. Bad news is that it will take a very long time to ""recover"" and at my age that may be only 75% of what it was. 


TL;DR: While viewing a CT scan of my knee with a specialist  I remarked how nice the fat marbling was as if grading a steak. Now I wonder if the guy thinks I'm a cannibal.",ima314lot,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,2,0,0,,2,0
/r/tifu/,tifu,"TIFU by making homemade ""temporary"" hair dye and turning everything green","Sorry for the plain format  I'm on mobile. This also happened 2-3 years ago when i was so much younger and thought Jared Leto's joker was cool. 

A couple friends of mine invited me one day to attend a cosplay event. I've never been to one and never really was into that but one of my friends convinced me to go. I decided to go as Jared Leto's Joker cuz younger me thought he was the shit. I had one of my friends help me come up with a costume. 

A day before the event  everything was ready save for the hair which my friend says he has covered because he has a green wig I can wear. What I had in mind were those temporary hair color things because I basically had the same haircut all I had to do was make it green but I trusted my friend.

The day of the event comes in and my friend shows up with some cheap ass party wig which was nothing like I expected. I was really disappointed cuz everything was on point save for the hair. It looked like utter shit and made me look like some clown in a kids party instead of the Joker. 

I had a choice here. I could choose to wear the wig and look like a fool  or not wear it at all but look incomplete. I opted to go for the a 3rd choice and found another way: I was going to make my own hair dye. 

I was in a hurry so I took my pomade and mixed it up with green poster color. It actually worked like a charm! People even asked me if I actually had my hair colored. Aside from anything my hair touched turning green  it was fine. All I had to do was be wary about this for the day. Surprisingly  I had a blast but the horror came when it came time to take my costume off. 

Turns out  my homemade ""temporary"" hair dye wasn't so temporary at all. It was such a bitch to take off that it took me almost 3 hours of showering and trying out different techniques to finally take it all off. After the deed was done  the entire bathroom including the tub  sink  showerhead  and my towel had green smeers. 

But that's not all  turns out it didn't actually all come off. The next day  I woke up to find green stains on my bed where my head was. I showered again and shampooed like 10 times. It seemed like it was all gone but when I towel dried my hair  the new towel had green stains too. 

I didn't have time to deal with that though as I had school. During the course of the day I managed to put green stains on: a couple of my textbooks  a pop quiz paper  my phone  my friend's phone  the classroom wall  my uniform  my gf's shirt  and my bag. 

In the end  that was pretty stupid. I've also been traumatized from doing anything cosplay related again.

TL;DR: Decided to make my own temporary hair dye for a cosplay event after seeing that my friend expected me to wear a crappy wig  ended up turning everything green for 2 days.",Green_minded_joker,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,,2,0

/r/history/,history,The Largest Naval battle In history,"I was wondering what peoples standings are on the largest naval battle in history   you commonly see people saying it battle of Leyte gulf   however if you look at actual scale and numbers ancient battles such as the battle of actium (estimates of 400+ ships) Or even the ancient  battle of Battle of Cape Ecnomus (that had an amazing 680 ships in total) 


These numbers dwarf the around 300 ships and 400 Planes that took part in the battle of Leyte gulf  


I understand that these ancient numbers are oftenly shrugged off as many argue  the numbers are inflated and incorrect  and many also argue that the battle of Leyte gulf is the most decisive naval battle in history  which is also debatable since the battle of Battle of Cape Ecnomus saw Rome’s First Major Naval victory   and also practically won he first Punic war   and the battle of actium  decided Who / if there would ever be an emperor of Rome 

But also many rightfully claim a Japanese victory at Leyte gulf could of completely halted the American advance at could of Changed the result of WW2   though it is still arguable that the Allies still would of crushed the Japanese regardless   but would of been delayed 


I also understand that the massive technological difference considering the Massive Battleships and Cruisers aswell as even the destroyers were huge compared to the relatively small ships Of Ancient times

/r/history/,history,Daoist practices between 800-1200  with a focus on the provinces of qinghai  gansu and xinjiang,"Hello fine people 

I´ve asked the same question in r/askhistorians  for i suppose that answering it requires some in depth knowledge  but i´m also interested in what the hive  or people who don´t have the time to write an answer conforming to the standard of r/askhistorians  might come up with.

i adore philosophical daoism and i´m also a huge fan of the recently released game ""Crusader Kings 3"". This game offers the opportunity to play as various medieval rulers and dynasties and it´s a lot of fun.

It also allows one to play in parts of the provinces mentioned in the title  as a daoist ruler  which  considering my interest in daoism  is great fun.

Yet  it´s obviously only a game and it lacks nuance and depth. While it offers some information on religion  most can only be considered an very rough approximation  if at all.

But i would like to know how exactly  if it at all existed in the area  daoist religion would have looked liked in the years 800-1200  outside of china proper  in the provinces of qinghai  gansu and xinjiang along the silk road.

The game labels the daoism followed by some characters as ""Zhengyi-Daoism""- But information on it is quite scarce.

Or rather; All the information i find refers to practices and times far earlier or later or is very general  making it hard to decide when and where a certain practice or tradition was in place.

I´m especially interested in the following aspects:

1. How widespread was daoist practices during this time frame in the aforementioned provinces? Did it exist at all  if only amongst some rulers  or does the game take some liberties here?
2. What did religious practice look like?
3. How was the clergy organized?
4. The wikipedia mentions talismans and spells. How widespread were those and how did they look like? Which alchemistic practices were in use?
5. It also mentions the concept of bestowing ""registers""  espousing the schools teachings  on people entering daoism. Was this done in the mentioned timeframe? Was this only for priests?

I took a cursory glance at two sources mentioned in the wikipedia  the ""Taoism: Growth of a Religion"" by Isabella robinett and the ""The Encyclopedia of Taoism"".

But i didn´t find too much so far. Especially the second book seems to contain a lot of information  but again  it seems hard to get information on the place and the timeframe i wish to explore.

I've never read what later roman scholars thought about their own countrymen being at the very least partly responsible for the death of their savior. Did they put all of the blame on the jews who sentenced Jesus? Did they denounce Pontius Pilate for not intervening  or maybe they saw Jesus death as something necessary for the salvation of humanity?

The first one I put on /r/dataisbeatiful in two versions  [WIP](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ieg4c9/oc_monarchs_of_englanduk_revision_guide_wip/) and [Final with PDF link](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ii1m3h/oc_monarchs_of_englanduk_revision_guide_v2_pdfppt/). I have highlighted important events to situate the historical time. Any constructive comments would be welcome again. 

The next one is am working on it a less Anglo-centric chart of the British throne  [currently WIP.](https://i.imgur.com/FsMKLe0.png) The events highlighted are those that I think are crucial to the formation of the modern United Kingdom (Reformation  Treaties  Rebellions and Colonies etc.)  but of course  I can't include everything. 

1. I would love to see what a more history minded community thinks  and also have I made any mistakes?
2. Any comments on my current WIP would be most welcome. More Welsh/Irish inclusion  changes visually/aesthetically etc?
3. What other timelines could be simplified to the degree I have tried  but also educational and interesting to see in a similar fashion. I will look at the French throne afterwards  but the European thrones do get very intertwined easily. Chinese dynasties  Prime Ministers and Important Laws  any ideas?

/r/history/,history,Was there any other terrorist group in history like Shindo Renmei  Japanese immigrant who denied Japan's defeat in WWII?,"I find the story of Shindo Renmei fascinating  knowing it through a film Corações Sujos (Dirty Hearts).

As in many of the Allied countries during the war  Brazil discriminated against  and even imprisoned  immigrants from countries coming from the Axis. Thus  many Japanese and Brazilian-Japanese needed help even to feed themselves  and several groups  usually of a nationalist nature  was created for this purpose. Shindo Renmei was at first one of these groups that helped Japanese immigrants in Brazil during World War II.

However  after Japan's defeat  Shindo Renmei did not believe what happened  but that Japan won the war and the enemies wanted to deceive them. They even believed that Japan would soon send a boat to take them back to the country. They even distorted and falsified information that came from Japan. However  what stood out the most in this group was that for them  worse than a Brazilian saying that Japan lost the war  was that of a Japanese to believe it. Because of this  Shindo Renmei persecuted and murdered several Japanese and Japanese descendants in the interior of Brazil. After several murders  members of the group appeared with the weapon they used in the police station and confessed to the crime  something that is common in honor crimes.

I would like to know if in the history there were any groups similar to Shindo Remnei.",DELAIZ,09-05-2020,False,False,False,False,False,1,0,0,,9,0

The fact is; given that time is infinite this means that everything will happen at some point. For example  if you give a monkey an infinite amount of time to learn how to fly eventually it will be able to. It could take millions of years of evolution and or technology but with that we can understand that anything is possible given the circumstance that time is irrelevant. 

Time travel is exactly like that but a little more complex. Given that time is infinite we can break down the reasons for what time travel for us really means. 

Time travel will and has happened. The only thing is that the creators and users may not need to come
back to our time. Or on another completely different version of time travel it might be that time travelling doesn’t take you back in time to the world that you were in  but creates a completely different reality or dimension as such. 

In conclusion it is unscientific to discard the evidence of infinite time and the continuous loop of the modern day technology. Eventually someone will get it. It’s only a matter of when and how.",supersosa16,09-06-2020,False,False,False,False,False,13,0,0,,0,0

My name is Alex and my best friend is Sam. Long story short we’ve been on the run for a while now. Not from law enforcement or any type of authority but rather our pasts. Our families and our pasts. We both had our fair share of trauma and sobs stories which I won’t make you suffer through for now. But what I will ask is that you read this all the way through. On one of our many adventures through the city of Los Angeles  we found an abandoned building. Which yes is quite common if you go to the right places but this one was. Odd. It had a strange aura to it. So out of sheer boredom  we ventured into the so-called building. The outside had rusted steel poles. Rotting wood and broken windows yet no one on the outside seemed to pay attention to it. On the inside  it was truly bizarre. It did look rather torn up and old with absolutely no sign of life. But if it weren’t for the odd seemingly brand new steel doors we would have left right away. See now there doors were attached to the wall on the farthest left side. They looked large. Around 10 to 15 feet tall. We found it rather odd for them to be in a place such as this and intriguing if I’m being quite honest with you.

V2VsY29tZSwgdXNlci4gWW91ciBmaXJzdCBjbHVlIGxpZXMgaW4gdGhlIGhhbmRzIG9mIHVzZXJfdW5rbndvd25fcmVkYWN0ZWQu

See now at this point the two of us are quite. What’s the word? Engrossed at finding out what this door leads to. At first  we begin by attempting to slide the door open. Pushing and pulling at it with no luck. So as a last resort we begin looking around for anything that might open it. A key of some sort? After half an hour of looking  we found a keypad under a slab of fallen rotting wood. With Sam’s help  we manage to lift the wood coming out of it with a couple of splinters as I picked up the keypad slowly. Wires seemed to be protruding from the back nearly torn but not quite. I looked it over as Sam simply stood to the side quietly snapping pictures of the steel door. On a hunch  I began to press a few keys on the pad itself hoping it still worked. And to my surprise for every key I pressed a blue dot lit up on top of the doors. Sam rushed over grabbing the keypad before I could click one last key to fill up the last circle on the door.

“ALEX STOP IT WHAT IF IT’S LIKE THOSE EGYPTIAN TOMBS?!” she screamed at me. But I decided not to listen and snatched to keypad back. Keep note that numbers 826 were highlighted with green. Anywho I snatched the pad back and clicked the number 5. The doors made an electrical humming noise than a sort of blowdryer noise as they opened up slowly. I turned back to find Sam but couldn’t see her anywhere. I shrugged it off figuring she had chickened out and left back to our motel. I stepped into the doors and all there was seemed to be another room along with an elevator door words painted on the wall stating. 

“We were expecting you.”

In small black letters. I tilted my head to the left slightly and blinked only to find a sharp pinching sort of pain on the left side of my neck. Wincing I clutched it and began to feel dizzy my vision blurring and going black. I awoke in a rather luxurious hotel room where I am typing this now. I don’t remember how I got here other than what I’ve written. I have found an empty journal on the nightstand labeled. “The Crowess Initiative.” I attempted to contact Sam with no luck. Her cell phone going straight to voicemail. I even took the beginning portion of my morning to try and go back to the building. It was no longer there. With nothing better to do  I have turned to you all for help. I am terrified and unsure of what to do. With my best regards  I leave here to go search for Sam  figure out what happened in that building and where it has gone  and most of all. Figure out what the hell The Crowess Initiative is.",VtheVrunawayV,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,,1,0

“Some people fear that they’ll die in a plane crash their entire lives. And guess what? They die in a plane crash!  She made a video of a deer. And was killed by one.” I said. 

“Those people don’t make videos with the plane that they know is going to kill them.” Drew said. “And they don’t talk about the plane being part of some cult.”  
“We grew up outside of Pasadena. Where a religious studies teacher’s fascination with Aleister Crowley in our hometown isn’t any different than a musician in Nashville having a fascination with Elvis….” I said. 

“Graceland is in Memphis.”  Drew replied. “Nashville is different.” 

“In the long run Aleister Crowley was successful at bringing yoga to Southern California. The rest of the occult stuff is campfire stories for virgins that weren’t invited to many campfires.” I said. 

“Huck. You love problem solving. You prefer it to sleep. That’s why you take the modafinil. And yet none of this interests you?” he said. 

“Drew. What do you want from this?” I asked. 

A freezeframe of Carey K was on the monitor. At that time she was half the age we are now. More frightened than we have ever been in 15 years. He shrugged.

“So what’s our best outcome? There’s no real mystery here. The deer is dead. She is dead. I’m just failing to see how we get closure  justice  or money in any of this...” I said. 

Drew clicked on a video.  Scrolled past a few minutes.  
*It was Carey K. Opening a book. In a white room. Relaxed on the floor with a candle in front of her.  After a brief moment the camera shifted enough for us to realize that Carey hadn’t left the camera on a makeshift tripod. SOMEONE ELSE was controlling it.* 

*“You really got this for me?” she asked. Full flush on her face.* 

*“No. I wrote this for you. It was meant to find you.” the voice said. “Focus.”*

*“I mean. Look at these drawings. It’s just so….wow. It’s really gorgeous.” she said.* 

*Slowly Carey K’s hair began to rise a bit. As if it had had a powerful static shock from one of those plasma glass balls at the Science Museum touch it.* 

*“Focus now. It’s a book on Fertility. Alchemy. The Unknown Seasons” the voice said. “It carried over from the 14th century. I translated what I could.”* 

*“Oh.” she said.  Her shoulder length hair began to lift up even more. She tried to brush it back down but it stayed up.* 

*“Most people who die. Focus. They go nowhere. Some go to heaven. But not as many as you think. And even then. I suspect they don’t stay there for long. Focus. But if we make it to La Chambre Des Cauchemars. In a few decades  we can be the first to reproduce in the afterlife  Carey. That is the gift that we stole.” the voice said.* 

*“Why…. don’t you think people in heaven stay for too long?” she asked.* 

*“Do you think a person who never talks back to anyone enjoys being alone?” the voice asked.* 

*“I don’t know. I guess so?” she replied.* 

*“You’re losing focus. FOCUS.”* 

*Just then the camera tilted a bit.  For a split second. And it wasn’t totally clear. But it appeared that Carey K wasn’t on the floor at all. She was sitting upside down. On her own ceiling.* 

“You recognize that voice?” I asked. 

“I couldn’t even figure out the accent.” Drew replied. 

We listened to the voice. It was almost transforming every few words. It could have been a 70 year old woman. Or a 14 year old boy. 

“Want to take a stroll?”  I said. 

\----

We went to a 24 Hour Ralphs. Got some chips and watery shit guacamole. Drew stocked up on his own drug of choice : Sugar Free Red Bull. 

Carey K’s death impacted most of us for about a week.  
The first few days consisted of crying  shock  hugging. 

Watching the Evening News Van take b-roll of us in the parking lot.  
Couples that recently broke up getting back together.

A few people spoke out on the overpopulation of deer in our area.   
Some animal lovers lied and said that Carey K would never want her death to result in the death of more animals. 

A faceless quasi-friend of hers spoke at the wake  blaming herself for not carpooling with Carey on the ride home. 

Neither side really got a win. 

And we moved on.  
Events don’t really change much. 

“It was what…. fourteen years after her death when someone uploaded this?” I asked. 

“Yeah. Random dates in 2014  2015  and this last one was in 2017.” Drew replied. 

“How many views?” I asked. 

“15  24  2  3  6  12  2  2.” he said. “And maybe some of those are repeats from me. I don’t know if their system picks up on that.”  
“No comments?” I asked. 

“No comments.” Drew said. 

“It’s like they had a connection to her. Enough to transfer minidv to Youtube. But they didn’t have a strong enough will to share it with anyone else connected to her.” I said. 

“Can you maybe check public records to see about her will?” Drew asked. “Maybe her mom’s too?” 

I bent over the computer. Clicked on the comments section. 

*Hey There. Old friend of Carey Ks. How did you find this video? Also  who is the creeper talking to her about Fertility? Thanx.*

“Sometimes just asking is the easiest way of finding out.” I said. And pressed send. 

I drove home near the crack of dawn. Never a stranger to late night workaholicisms  I weighed the options of helping.

And whether helping Drew meant that I gave a damn about Carey K or the Youtube Channel.

Because I didn’t want to.

A few days passed. My trial ended. My weekend started. 

12 people completed their civic duty by letting another rich douchebag free due to charm and grudges against a system that forces them into jury duty.  
I even got confirmation that a reliable enough consultant to the firm was pulling up files we found on Carey K  her mom  her absent dad  and some random police reports.  

As I left my office for celebratory drinks I saw a Mercedes Sprinter in the parking lot. 

It was Drew. Holding up a folder and waving ‘hi’. 

I waved back. 

“Drew. How’d you find my office?” I asked. 

“My brother knows your firm.” he said. “He also got me ALL of the files. AND….Say hi to Stig.” 

Black bushy eyebrows. Pale skin. Dark eyes. Stig Hjortshøj waved at me from the passenger seat.  
He was wearing scrubs. On his day off. To remind me that he was Dr. Hjortshøj now

At our high school lunch table he was once labeled an Aristocratic Cybergoth.  
Now he gives colonoscopies to Clint Eastwood. And Facebook Updates us every time he watches an rerun of Big Bang Theory with his winter wear fashion czar wife  Meaghan. 

“Man. You know it sucks like Carey K’s death that we haven’t seen each other in 5 years. But what a way to kickstart this re-union  huh?” Stig asked. 

“Sorry?” I said. 

“Your office assistant didn't tell you?! We got a reply to your comment. On the video.” Drew said. 

“Oh. Yeah.” I said. 

“Yeah. They said *‘You Were Not The Person Who Was Supposed To Find This. Please Do Not Share.'* ” Drew said.

""You freaked them out. They know we're on to them  Huck."" Stig said. ""Game on. That's what I say!""  
“That really sounds like it might be a dead end. I’m getting some drinks with co-workers if you want to come and hang for a bit?”

“No drinking for me. I talked to a few people. Carey K and her mom donated their bodies to science but they both got rejected. BIG TIME.” Stig said. 

“Yeah?” I said. 

“Yes. Because of suicide. Even lethal injections are a huge no-no in the medical community. So we’re going to drive and see if we find them. And maybe a few other little clues tonight since I'm not on call.” Stig said.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,We Tied the Basement Door Closed,"**Mountain Lake  Minnesota was established as an official town in 1872. 28 years later  on the very outskirts of what could be considered city limits  a little blue house was built. Some strange things can happen to a home in a hundred years.**

One thing I never learned in school was just how damn *expensive* life becomes when you leave the nest and become a bona fide adult. At the ripe age of 19  living in a Colorado home composed of myself  my partner  father  step mother  and a man I barely knew  things suddenly got complicated. The unrelated roommate had accused my partner and I of breaking a firm rule in our lease  and those with much more life experience and bitterness toward the youth of today couldn't be convinced otherwise. We could barely afford the family and friends discount on the rent  and we were screwed.

The community resources didn't have any available properties. Craigslist offered creeps  old women with strict rules  and crackheads at a price we couldn't afford. Facebook groups were upper middle class families that couldn't subject their children to a disabled alternative girl and pothead boyfriend. None of our friends nearby had rooms in their apartments to sublet. We were getting desperate to find a roof before winter and our grace period on our remaining lease had a mere 38 days left to offer.

It was about 1 am when I received a message I didn't quite expect. It's not every day your partner's ex-fling decides to be friendly with you.

*Taylor: Hey  I've noticed you and Silas's posts. It's a longshot  but we have space for you guys up here  and it's dirt cheap. We already have a job that'll take him on.*

And so it was decided. Last week of October  we loaded our SUV with everything that could fit  piled bags of food and cigarette packs on the floor of the passenger seat  said goodbye to friends and family  and made the 733 mile drive to our own personal hell.

-----

Sleep deprivation is a funny thing. It can cause unnecessary paranoia and simultaneously make you feel comfortable in the most unsafe environments. After a 17 hour drive  mostly in the middle of the night  I was more worried about the ketchup stains on my shirt from the gas station hot dogs than the overwhelming feeling of dread as I stepped onto the land of our new home. After shaking hands with Cameron  Taylor's husband  we got to work unloading our belongings and introducing the car.

An hour later  as we sat with Cameron smoking in the garage  conversation fell flat. Watching this stranger shift in his seat uncomfortably  I had to try not to laugh at his deadpan expression as the next four words broke free from his lips  forming a pained expression as he finished the short sentence.

""The basement is haunted.""

I glanced at Silas to see his reaction and it was similar to mine. I'm not a skeptic by any means  I'm fascinated and enthralled by the paranormal. However I didn't expect to be thrown into it unknowingly like this and it struck me as odd and funny how I came to learn of the aura of our new home.

""How do you mean?"" I asked  trying to mask the laughter bubbling in my chest.

""Oh  I don't know. We hear a lot of conversations and arguments down there  but it's just us here. It's altogether just spooky down there. The door opens and closes on its own a lot  so we have it tied shut now "" he said  rushing and stumbling over his words. He avoided eye contact as he said this  and I couldn't help looking down the concrete stairs.

*""Well I'll be damned. He's not kidding ""* I thought to myself.

-----

The first week wasn't too out of the ordinary. Two couples trying to learn to cohabitate while one member from each has a... *history* with the other is uncomfortable  but that's to be expected. It wasn't until Taylor and Cameron started to suck us dry financially that stress arose and with it  the oddities.

At first we begun to hear the conversations. Then the arguments. Then the screaming  or laughter  or what sounded like a large banquet in the days when horse and carriage were common and a million players kept the women pure from the wrath of God. We denied it having an impact on us  but it certainly made tensions worsen when things were already bad.

At the time  I read runes  dice  and tarot. Cleansings were done every 3 days when I felt particularly negative  and crystals sat in the window of our room. Silas regularly joked that the spirits in the basement were threatened by me and that's why they got so loud when we showed up. I laughed it off but some small feeling deep within my chest ached with anxiety when it was brought up. I asked the runes one day and got no response initially  but the next morning we awoke to footsteps in the snow leading to each couple's window. What was odd  however  was that Silas and I lived upstairs  and the footsteps came up the wall.

Three days after the footsteps  everything went nuts. Cam and Taylor had just asked us for another $350 after we had forked over $700 the day before. We paid what we could  and they got a new puppy and a steak dinner while we ate expired hot dogs with buns that had the moldy bits picked off meticulously. I learned an important lesson that night. Don't fight with your partner when you're both hungry and broke.

After swallowing the last miserable bite of my meal  I turned to Silas.

""These people are bleeding us of our resources and they're rude as hell. No wonder you stopped fucking Taylor after 2 weeks  she's a spoiled rotten woman with an attitude that puts ""cash me ousside"" girl to shame.""

Apparently  Silas and Taylor never had sex. They kissed a few times but she mostly just leeched off of him. However  with hunger pains still echoing in our tummies and excessive noise from the basement making it impossible to relax  it was a bad time to have this talk and tensions rose. 

It quickly turned into hell in that house. As Silas and I fought  Taylor made every comment about how awful I was and how she should've been better to Silas cause things would've ended up good for them. Silas was screaming and throwing things at me  and I was scared out of my mind as he was never a loud or aggressive person. I was kicked out of the bedroom and as I slept downstairs  plans were made to kick me out entirely. The 4 foot wall of snow kept building as did my panic. Alone on the 1st floor  scared and crying  I avoided sleep as I knew I'd have nightmares. Looking back  I would have preferred them.

If I stood still for more than a second  there were taps from underneath the floorboards in counts of three. If I sat down  I felt tingling and stabbing in my back until I stood again. I eventually grew tired of the torture in the livingroom and decided to smoke in the garage.

That damn basement. Roaring laughter erupted from the staircase with every tear that rolled down my cheek. It had never been so loud and clear before. As I stood to go inside  I glanced down and froze in place. The blood drained from my face and I began to shake.

The door was open.

As adrenaline  fear  and anger combined in my chest  I ran down the stairs and grabbed the handle. As I tried to pull the door shut  another door leading to the backdoor slammed. I screamed and pulled the door as hard as I could and tied it again. As I ran back into the house  the tapping escalated to loud booms and every light turned on. Despite wanting to avoid Silas  I ran into the room and slammed the door. I turned around  saw his furious face  and blacked out.

-----

I finally awoke to Silas crying and shaking me awake. When my eyes finally opened  it was a gruesome scene. During my blackout we had apparently fought more. At one point  I had asked him why he was being so evil  and this sent him into a rage. He pushed me and went outside. While he was gone  I had grabbed a knife and slashed my legs open. Now awake  my thighs burned and my skin felt sticky and stung when I moved. As soon as he stepped outside  he was immediately calm and he broke down. After a half hour of crying  he came in to apologize and found me like that. The knife was thrown out the window before I was awoken.

At 3:38 am  when I was able to stand without getting dizzy  he brought me downstairs to clean me up. After my bath  Silas made me some tea and out me to bed. I woke up repeatedly to nightmares  however I was grateful to be warm inside and have the man I had fallen in love with so long ago to snuggle up to  no longer the terrifying monster he had turned into.

When I finally sat up in bed in the morning and checked my phone  my heart dropped.

*Taylor to Homestead Group: Glad you guys made up. We need to ask another favor... our car broke down when I took Cam to work... We found another but it's $600 and we only have $75 left of what you've already loaned us... We have Lainey's car until we get it figured out.*

I tapped on Silas to wake him up and showed him the message. For a brief moment  that unfamiliar rage sparked in his eyes again and I felt my chest tighten. But as soon as it came  it passed.

As the day went on  we reviewed our bank statements to figure out how much it cost in gas to get to Minnesota. A blizzard was about to hit so we would have to prepare for a couple extra stops. So  we called my mother. It turned out we would be home for Thanksgiving after all. At 6:03 pm  Taylor and Cameron left to get groceries. At 6:34 pm  our car was packed with all of our belongings  and we were stopped in the next town over for gas.

We made it home safely and within a month  Silas got a great job. With the help of his mother  we now have our very own apartment. I lay here now  telling our story as I stroke his hair  thankful for a full belly  a quiet home beside his gentle snoring  and a good day together.

Unfortunately though  since we left the house built in 1900  on the outskirts of Mountain Lake  MN  I hear tapping under my foot every time I walk above a basement. And it takes every ounce of strength not to tie the door shut.",Wet-_-Socks,09-07-2020,False,1599388335.0,False,False,False,0,0,0,,5,0
/r/nosleep/,nosleep,A murder of crows is ruining my life.,"Crows. Very smart animals. They've always fascinated me  you see. So  when I moved across the country and had the opportunity to befriend the corvine fellow that started visiting me every morning I was elated.

I gave him fruits  nuts  seeds and with time I learned his favorite food: peanuts.
I invented several games and puzzles for him  always rewarding him with a few of his favorite snacks.

Over the course of several months  he started bringing me gifts: small rocks  a lost earing here  a cigarette butt there  some coins. I was so happy with this development I kept every single one of them in a small box.

Everything was going great and Joe (that's the name I picked for him) was a ray of light in my otherwise grey and dull life. 

Then  this summer  I went on holiday for a couple of weeks  never for once thinking that was gonna destroy the friendship I took so long to build. 

When I got home I couldn't believe my eyes. My lawn was filled with the corpses of several dead animals: small birds  rats  and other rodents  every single one of them missing their eyes. 
I thought it was just a coincidence  a freak event of nature  maybe even something to do with global warming. 
Then I saw something stuck to my front door. 
It was a drawing of hundreds of crows feasting on a human's corpse. 

I  being a rational human being  thought someone was just playing a prank on me. I was pissed off but I didn't pay it too much mind. 

In a couple of days (after removing all the corpses in front of my house) I'd already forgotten all about it. Mostly cause I was worried about something else: Joe. Usually  he would visit every day  but I had yet to see him. 

I tried walking around the neighborhood calling for him  leaving peanuts in my lawn  hell  I even took up birdwatching to see if I could spot him fly around my house. 

When nothing worked  I feared the worst. Had he gotten injured and came to me looking for help  only to find a dead and empty house? I felt guilty and miserable for weeks. 
Every morning a remainder of my missing friend. 

About a month after Joe stopped visiting me  a couple of days ago  I found an eyeball in front of my doorsteps. The place where Joe would usually leave his gifts. 
I didn't know what to make of the situation and  for some reason  I decided to examine the... thing... crouching near it. 
It was human. A human eyeball. A human eyeball with several holes in it  like someone... something pecked at it. 

Again  I tried to approach this from a rational standpoint. Was there a gas leak in my home? Did I hit my head somewhere and forgot it? Was I going crazy? 

I mean  there was NO way a crow was threatening me cause I left to go on holiday  right? 

I stared at the damn eyeball for several minutes before realizing I was going to be late at work if I stared at it any longer. 
I let it go. Surely it was just a coincidence. 
When I came back home I found another eyeball next to the previous one  the same holes in it. 
Too tired to deal with that shit on a Friday night I opened my door  slammed it  and just went to bed. 

When I woke up  a crow was on my chest staring at me. I don't know if it was Joe. I just know that I never felt dread set in me so quickly. I bolted up and out of my bed as fast as I could  sending the bird flying on top of my wardrobe. 
I closed myself in my bathroom  only to turn around and see three crows staring at me. I ran to my kitchen. More crows. More fucking crows. 
I reached for my front door only to freeze as soon as I opened it. 

My lawn had turned black overnight. Or  as I realized after a few seconds of staring incredulously at it  hundreds of crows were all over it  staring at me. 

I took a few deep breaths. This is a nightmare  I thought. Of course. Just a nightmare. 
Still  I couldn't help but feel utterly terrified under the careful watch of the sea of corvids. 

I decided dealing with a few crows was better than dealing with hundreds of them and shut the door  turning to face the intruders. 

""Ok  look guys  I don't know what you think happened but I never meant any harm. To any of you. I think you're all beautiful creatures  really.""

Okay  maybe trying to talk with crows wasn't that smart but I was at a loss. Either this was a nightmare or... Hundreds of crows were actually on my lawn  which is just insane.
At that point  trying to talk with birds seemed the least insane thing that happened since I woke up. 

They didn't answer  anyway. Just kept staring. 

""Do you... Do you want some peanuts?"" 

Nothing. 

Several minutes passed  me staring at the crows and them staring at me  the bird-like movements that I once found so endearing now making my blood run cold. 

Another crow flew into my window  the window that was supposed to be shut but was actually open  for some reason. 
This one was different. It was slick and wet with some kind of liquid. A liquid that was now falling on my floor in crimson drops. 

I shuddered and realized I had to run  immediately. I yanked the tablecloth from under the other crows and unlocked the door  running into the sea of crows and lashing at them with it  trying to stop them from coming anywhere near my face and  more importantly  my eyes. 

I ran for dear life straight into the street and then I kept running without looking back. 

When I calmed down and made sure no freaking bird was following me I called a coworker  asking if I could spend the night with her cause I just painted my walls and the smell was unbearable.

""It's nine in the morning. Surely the smell would be gone before this evening?""

Fuck. I muttered an apology and in a moment of anger and hopelessness just threw my phone against a tree. It broke on impact. I was so overwhelmed by the insanity of what was happening I just started crying and sat against that same tree.

A couple of hours went by before I made up my mind. No bird was gonna drive me out of my fucking home. I went to the library and searched the internet for exterminators that could deal with birds and I did found a few... I mean  they mentioned birds like pigeons and seagulls but there isn't much difference  right?

Then I borrowed the phone of a young man and made an appointment (""it's urgent"") for several hours later. I had to pay a hefty bonus but money was the last thing on my mind. I just had to get rid of the damn crows. 

Making my way home was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Every bone  every muscle in my body was telling me to run. My body was going crazy  adrenaline flowing into my system like I was about to die. I should've listened. 

I got there five minutes too late. I saw the car of the exterminator before I saw his body. He was splayed on the hood of the car with the clothes ripped and rendered asunder. 
Where there should have been eyes there were just two bloody holes.
I had no time to understand HOW he died cause out of the corner of my eyes I saw a black mass in the sky. Coming for me. 

I bolted towards the library again  the closest building to my neighborhood. 

I got there just in time. I was stuck. Terrified. Scouring the internet for an explanation. Any explanation. I knew crowns could hold grudges and communicate with each other but this... This is was insane. 

Honestly  I knew I wasn't safe  even in there. I kept seeing that crow wet with blood in the corner of my vision  I kept feeling it behind my back  and I knew I wasn't gonna be able to run forever. 

It's just a bird  you may say  but it felt like so much more. They were all terrifying but... that thing was different. It was like staring at death itself. 

I looked up from the computer for a minute and I saw Joe. A piece of paper in his mouth. How do I know it was Joe? I just know  okay? He's my friend. I wasn't afraid of him  even after everything  and I swear his eyes looked sad. 
I held out my hand and he dropped the paper in my hand. Hesitantly  I reached out with my other hand  trying to scratch his head. 
He allowed me to do it but there was an urgency in him. I could feel it. I looked down to examine the paper: an address had been hastily scribbled on it. 
When I looked up  Joe was gone. 

I knew what I had to do. The place was about ten minutes from the library. 
I exited and ran like a madman  not even bothering to look for crows in the vicinity  I could feel them staring at me. 
I only stopped when I reached my destination. 
I was standing in front of an abandoned house with a rusty gate. I hesitated  only to push it open when I started hearing cawings behind me. 
I sprinted to the house and entered the half-rotten wooden door. 

The building was eerily silent  except... someone was humming. I followed the sound  desperate for someone that could explain what the hell was happening to me. 
I went through several rooms  each one more wrecked than the one before: every piece of furniture was destroyed and pushed to the corners and the floors were covered by scratches and dark stains. 

Finally  I found the source of the humming. A young girl sat on a rocking chair with a crow perched on her shoulder. Joe. 
She stopped humming and looked at me  then smiled. 

""Martin! You made it. I'm glad.""

Everything about the situation was just wrong but for some reason  I trusted her. 

""Ah... How do you know my name?"" 

She laughed heartily at my question before answering. 

""Joe told me"" she winked at me ""his real name is Joshua  by the way. He also told me you've been very kind to him. Unfortunately  that's what made the others get jealous and  well..."" she sighed ""They kinda got out of my control.""

My head began to spin. 'A nightmare. This is a nightmare. What the hell is happening? A nightmare. A nightmare.' 
And before I realized it I passed out. 
I woke up in a bed a couple of hours ago  in the same house I passed out in  and I've spent those hours looking for the girl and/or Joe. Or Joshua? 

I can't  for the life of me  find them. I can't even find the damn rocking chair. 
But I think I'm at least safe in here. I'm not seeing or hearing any crows and for now  that's enough. 

I think I'll go back to sleep now  I'm exhausted. I'll think about whether I'm losing my mind or not when I woke up. Maybe you guys can give me your opinion on the matter? Ahah. I just had to share this with someone.",Unika0,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,2,0,0,,9,0
/r/nosleep/,nosleep,I Hunt Fairies - Part 1,"I don’t mean fairies as in a slur  or anything  I’m not some bigot or Neanderthal. I mean Fairies  as in Fae  a nasty bunch of primordial buggers. Don’t believe all those stories you read as a kid  or the crap Hollywood spoon fed ya  these creeps are the stuff nightmares. Also they aren’t magical per se. Sure they can control the weather  turn invisible and make things move with their mind  but that's not magic  it’s biology. A different  super advanced  screwed up kind of biology  but biology all the same.  

You see the species  has a unique trait  officially the agency I work for calls this trait  Hyper Evolutionary Adaptation  or HEA for short. What that means is these things  evolve fast  very fast. What would take a normal animal a few million years  Fae can achieve in a century  maybe less. Because of this  the species has proliferated into countless sub species and variations  each with their own unique abilities and appearances. Due to their hyper evolving capabilities  they gain seemingly unnatural ‘powers’ such as being able to live for centuries without physically ageing  being able to camouflage themselves or release mind controlling pheromones; you get the idea.

It's Not Magic  It's Science!  

Mind you one thing that most stories and tales get right  is their dislike of people. They are not to fond of us at all; on account of us chopping down their forests and paving over their sacred sites  but that’s the way of progress  Vae Victis (woe to the conquered) am I right.  

Still it’s never pleasant when you track a Bogart down and get there to late. I was cleaning fourth grader off my shoes for weeks.  

I’ll give you a brief description if you like. 

**Bogart**  cousin to Brownie  but unlike the relatively benign Brownie  **Bogarts** are boulder sized brutes  with bright blue skin and no neck or head. Instead they have an enormous circular maw  filled with jagged spurs and spikes  and rows of teeth that rotate like the blades of a power saw. **Bogarts**  can turn invisible at will  but you know if you have one in your house  as their body odour causes milk to curdle.  

This Bogart had made a home for itself in a fourth grade class room. It’s egg had been laid in the ceiling above and **Bogarts** grow fast  like three days and they are fully grown ravenous monsters.  

Unfortunate that I got there too late. He really made a mess of that place; arms  legs  and scalps were strewn everywhere. The little blighter thought he was going to have an easy meal  when I stepped through the door  but I wasn’t desert and though his invisibility camouflage works on others  it doesn’t work on me; but that's a trade secret.

I played along for a bit  let him creep around the class room  pretending I couldn’t see  then when he opened his big mouth  I really gave him something snack on. A couple of shotgun rounds  stuffed full with iron filings.  

Oh yeah  if you ever find yourself up against a fae of any kind  iron is your best bet. They hate the stuff. Turns out  that whilst biologically they are god like beings  their speedy evolution process left them with a handful of strange hang ups  one of them being a toxic allergic reaction to iron.  

If you’re wondering why I’m telling you all this  maybe it’s because I feel you all have a right to know what really goes bump in the night  or perhaps I’m just tired  and need to vent.  

The Round Table  the agency I work for doesn’t exactly have therapists. Its more of a hired gun kind of situation. Sure you get all your expenses paid for and get to travel the world  but you are kind of in the trenches all by yourself  twenty four hours a day. Perhaps it’s better that way  I mean I ran with someone once  Percival (not her real name of course)  and well I lost her...

Maybe we will talk about that another time. I’m sure you just want to hear more about the beasties I slay am I right?

Well lets see  there was this one time  the round table received reports of a Chupacabra attack in Ireland  which is just ridiculous  everyone knows Chupacabra are desert dwelling bloodsuckers. For that reason we were hesitant to investigate it. There are agencies out their to handle monsters  we handle fae  we don’t step on their patch and they don’t step on ours.

Naturally though  I was curious  so I offered to go see what it was all about.  

So I went  travelled by plane  then by dodgy mini van  then by tractor  through the pot hole riddled country side  all the way to the village of Greenwills. A crap-hole peasant town that the world forgot.  Where all the people were as pale as ghosts  and all their homes had leaky roofs and outdoor toilets. It was like a step back in time to say the least  I mean I’m not even sure the rest of Ireland knows Greenwills even exists. Anyway I was staying in the only accommodating in the village  a solitary ramshackle inn called the Drunken Pixie  apt considering my profession.  

Decor wise  the inn had a unique take on decorating  mounted fox and cat heads over every doorway and wood worm eaten timber beams. I remember getting to my room  looking at the moss crawling up the inside of the window and just thought  I don’t get paid enough for this.  

However I’m a professional  so I went downstairs for a drink  hoping that perhaps if I got drunk enough the black mould on the ceiling wouldn’t look so bad.  

Besides if ever you need to know everything about anything  you go to the bloke behind the bar.  

The landlord and barman  was a portly fella  named Pádraig. He had no hair on the top of his head and smell like hobnobs & ham.  

Seemed like a nice enough bloke  gave me a pint of their finest pig swill and we got to talking about the cattle deaths.  

Pádraig was quick to correct me  as he nervously said.  

“It ain’t just the sheep  it’s been taking.” he whispered in a hushed tone  his fear painted in the wrinkles of his face. “Keiran  a lad from down the road  got bit by it. Sucked dry  until he was pale and cold.”  

Straight away I knew I wasn’t dealing with a chupacabra  they rarely ever feed on humans and certainly wouldn’t if there was still an abundance of livestock in the area.   

“And this Keiran  was he a bit of a ladies man perhaps?” I asked  in my heart  knowing the answer that would come.

“Aye  how’d you know. Always had a different lass every week. The last one he brought in here  was something else  dark hair and eyes like sapphires.” Pádraig claimed  his eyes becoming misty and enchanted just thinking about the mysterious girl.

A   **Leannán**    a tricky little bloodsucker  but I knew how to draw her to me and more importantly  I knew how to put her down.  

The **Leannán** are shape shifters  masters of disguise who appear as pale skinned women with sapphire eyes and an enchanting beauty. However beneath this veil  they are a predatory vampiric organism  that loves to gorge itself on the blood of poets  but will settle for lovesick men and even cattle. Their true visage is monstrous  with a vaguely humanoid upper body  with a scaleless snake like head. Their lower bodies become a whipping singular tale  similar to the body of a serpent  but again lacking in scales. Their mouths had bioluminescent hypodermic fangs for extracting blood and their long flowing locks of hair become gravity resistant tendrils that allow them to glide.  

“You’re cattle problem will be sorted tonight.” I told him as I placed down my glass and went up upstairs to collect my things.  

Making my way to the border of the cliff topped village  I tried to make sure I was far enough from the residents; don’t want them getting involved  it always leads to more trouble than it’s worth.  

It was the perfect place for a fight. 

So I readied myself  prepared my voice and then called the fairy to me. 

“Cold blows the wind over my true love  Cold blows the drops of rain. I never had but one true love  and in Camville she was slain.” I sang  my voice failing to do justice to the ballad.  

However as the fog rolled in around me  like walls of rolling clouds  I knew it had worked.  

“One kiss  one kiss of your lily white lips  one kiss is all I crave. One kiss  one kiss of your lily white lips and return back to your grave.” a female voice  silvery and smooth sang out from the mist. 

“I’ve not heard that song  in a life time. What’s you’re name sweet man.” the female voice claimed as she emerged from the mist  hourglass shaped  pale and nude with shining blue sapphire eyes.

“Gwaine.” I told her.  

“I knew a Gwaine once  he was like you. A hunter!” she snarled  her beauty desecrating itself before my very eyes.  

Unveiling the iron chain whip hidden within my long coat  I launched it forward  towards the shape shifting fem fatale. And with a loud metal clang  it struck her  causing an explosive reaction that cast her back into the fog.

Blistered and burned  she whipped her tail towards me  her long legs having been replaced by the scaleless snake like limb.

Ducking beneath her attack  I struck her with a thunderous punch from my salt soaked iron dusters  branching her skin with welts.  

Hissing and screeching she recoiled into the mist  vanishing before my eyes.  

Suddenly she sprung forth once more  slashing the backs of my legs as she glided by.  

Amused  her laughter resonated all around me  rippling across the cliff top.

Once more she attacked  this time her long writhing black head tendrils thrashing my chain from my grasp and knocking me off my feet.  

As I struggled to find my feet  she taunted me.  

“Did you think me a fool  so easily lured. You are not the first hunter I have crossed paths with.” snarled the bloodsucking fairy.  

“I’m sure I’m not  but I will be the last.” I assured her.  

She launched herself at me  claws ready to rend my flesh and her jaws wide open. However before she could sink her bioluminescent blue fangs into my flesh  and slurp me up like I was a milkshake  I dodged to the side and brought down a horseshoe upon the back of her neck.  

Driving her down into the grown  the horseshoe embedded into the earth  burning her claws and skin as she struggled against it. It was over  for the wriggling nightmare.  

“Please spare me  I was content to feed on sheep. Kieran deserved his fate  he used me and tossed me aside like I was nothing. Please you have to understand I was just angry  I wont do anything like this again.” she pleaded  her monstrous form shrivelling back into her female human disguise.  

Part of me did feel for her  I’m sure Kieran did treat her badly  but that doesn’t give her the right to drink his life away. More importantly  say I did let her go  what was to stop her from getting angry again.  

“I’m sorry.” I told her  as I drove a dagger into her heart.  

“You will be hunter  of you will be. When the Under rises  you will know suffering.” she wheezed.  

Empty threats I thought  from the lips angry lips of the dead.

A glance over at the clock revealed that it read 4:03 AM  once again. A sigh escaped my lips  a heavy roll of my eyes and I hadn't noticed until I stood  but the room had a different blue tint to it.The lamp light  my once white carpet  my bed draped in a dark red satin sheet  even the dark brown door  everything was soaked in blue  uncharacteristic to the usual blackness that loomed over my room at this time. The doorknob seemed to enlight in flames in my hand  earning a nice burn on my flesh and a quick release. 

So much for using the door  I needed a different escape. Time ticked down  panic begins to set in. I'd never been forced to use the window  there was always an overwhelming put of despair anytime I even glanced at it  especially during the day. Blood trickled to the floor  the heat burnt into my hand but had not apparently seared it. With a heavy sigh  I throw the blankets off my bed and climb up to the window. The window  never precariously locked  was a jar. Odd  it was merely an inch but deadbolts don't just come off randomly. 

The scratching grew louder  nagging at me to hurry. It had now moved from behind my closet door to beneath my bed  a foot or so beneath my bare feet. My feet hit hard on the pavement below my window  the window shuts with a wham behind me. 

""So  the door was locked today?"" A woman behind me startled me. Her cheeks were sunken in  yet black hair stuck to her pale flesh wrapped tightly around her sharp cheekbones. My mouth slightly fell  but I didn't have long to think before I spun and I was face to face with hundreds of different men and women  or so it seemed. Most seemed dead  but the others were positively lifeless corpses. Somehow they were still standing and their face  painted with a malicious smile  will haunt me from here on out. Their hearts  continued beating despite being ripped out of the cavities of their chest  sat firmly in blood stained hands hanging stiffly from shoulder bones at their sides.  

They radiated calm  until well the screaming. Their hair was glued to their skulls  hardened with dried blood  pasty white flesh draped over their protruding bones  eyes that did not look into his soul  but seemingly past it  but the one thing that chilled me to the bone was their smile. It was plastered upon their face  as it could possibly be called  teeth escaped their voids and left  blood trickling down their chins. 

With no lips  their mouth was left uncovered and open to all eyes to peer into. Talking wasn't in their agenda  it was feeding. A black ooze seemed to form more plentiful the more I let fear in. That's how they ate  and that's what was about to happen. The screaming  I had never heard this before. It wasnt a scream of anger  pain  or fear  it was pure excitement. 

Pain from my childhood now felt surreal  no scraped knee or broken arm could measure up to this. Blood pooling at my feet only made me aware of my numbness and helplessness to the situation  my hands clasped around my ears to block out the noise  to no avail. With a deep breathe everything fades  my eyes close and the screaming sets it. It's getting louder. 

I can't hear anything. My ragged breathing and panting left long ago and the only indication I was still alive with the blood dripping from in between my fingers. The more they close in  the more I can't feel. The only noise over their high pitched scream but that of their teeth  clattering as they mocked my fear. They were here to feast and I had walked in with a red apple in my mouth. 

I sit up. My body shivers  I was drenched in sweat. A quick glance around my room assured me I was awake  everything was the normal color and the clock didn't read 4:03 anymore. The pages of my journal fluttered as I flipped through it  nearing the end  to find an empty page and I started writing.

""Last night was  well different. I wish I wasn't alone. She didn't show up  but she was replaced with the other woman  come to think they were almost identical. 
Perhaps tonight I'll see her again and I can ask her what happened? Oh well  school starts soon. I should be off  perhaps today I could make a friend. Maybe one day these will make sense  I need to know why..."" 

I trailed off  thinking. After two years and the dreams hadn't stopped. They hadn't particularly gotten worse  but it was never better. Perhaps that was the eternity of things  to figure out who these people were and why I was the feast  maybe I took someone else's place?

""Honey it's 7:00! Time to go to school!!"" A hard rap of knocks on my door startled me  my journal flew from my hand and across the room. My mother's footsteps trailed off down the hall after a quick reassurance I was awake and getting ready for school.

As I walked to the bathroom I noticed my clothes had blood on them  a quick look in the mirror revealed dried blood from my ears. That was  different  as well. Odd. 

Maybe help from an outside source? I ran over to my computer and quickly looked up the website  if anyone could help I knew it would be you guys. 
Should I try the door again? Maybe something different will happen this time  since I've encountered the screamers  as I've labeled the horrifying creatures.
Should I try my other window? At the headboard of my bed there's a small window  the one I exited through last night. Although  in my bathroom I do have another window. I could try to go through my bathroom  then exit out that window?",maliciouslyconspired,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,1,0,0,,3,0
/r/nosleep/,nosleep,I will have always seen destiny,"   
It is September 26th  1997  and I have just been born. I don’t scream or cry as I leave my mother’s womb and enter the doctor’s hands. I will always know that the pain of life is much more than the pain of being born. 

It was a Friday in August  2022. I am watching a documentary about the rise of Hitler in the Nazi party when Dr. Donnelly knocks on my bedroom door. It is one I will never see completely because of the conversation that will happen.

I say for him to enter because I know he’s going to. And because he doesn’t know he’s going to until I tell him. 

“Hello Sophia…” He said as he opened the door  “how are you doing today?”

“My bodily functions are normal at this instance and I will not die for another five years.” This is the first time I mention any specific time tied to this answer.

August 15th  2003  my mother tries to describe how people don’t know what they’re going to do or what happens around them when it’s not the present. I never truly understand.

Dr. Donnelly took some notes on the clipboard he was carrying before he continued  “Is there any particular reason you decided to tell us how long you’ve decided to live?”

Dr. Donnelly was a fisherman. Waited patiently for any answer I was destined to give him. Either he didn’t know when I would tell him or he saw destiny as well and knew he had to ask without receiving an answer.

“Because this instance is where I tell you.”

He nodded and made some more notes. I saw the clipboard as the rest of his office burned. These notes are the only ones readable in the 37 seconds I’m in his office before exiting the facility. They say  ‘Patient #032 still unwilling to divulge necessary information. Suggestion to increase electric shock to two times a week.’ 

September 3rd  2000. I turn to my mother and speak  with vocal chords just developed enough to speak in full sentences  and say  “I need to use the bathroom mother.”

My mother gives a long look at me. I can see the surprise in her face even through the astigmatism that will not be corrected for another year. This instance is the first time I have spoken in front of her.

It will be January  2015  and I will watch the first 37 minutes of *Airplane!* Before my mother hits the top step of the stairwell I will turn it off and watch the last 51 minutes in February  2019  when I am in captivity and Dr. Donnelly has given me movie privileges back after I informed him of his daughter’s death in May  2018.

It is December 2012. I do not open the small wrapped box my mother has given me for christmas. I do not see what is in it until the masked soldiers burst into our house in July  2018  when one of them throws the small bookshelf on the ground in an unnecessary attempt to stop me from leaving my room and escaping their raid. The top of the box opens and a pocket watch falls onto the ground in my open view before a bag is thrown over my head and I am knocked out.

I do not need a watch.

It will be June  2018 and I will write this down for the person who sees it. I do not see the chain that leads to my escape in the last moments but I know this writing has to happen if the last instance experienced fresh air before the last instance ends.

It is a Saturday  August of 2022 and I am being led to the electroshock therapy room. Doctors Donnelly and Laura are set to administer the treatment this day. Dr. Laura is kind to all of my instances and is not informed of the brain tumor that will fail to kill her before the radiation shuts down most of her internal organs.

Dr. Donnelly puts the electrodes on my head before checking to make sure my arm and leg restraints are secure.

Every Wednesday from August  2018 to September  2022  and every Saturday from August 2022 to September  2022  I will be taken for electroshock treatment. I never learn the reason for the treatment in any instance.

Dr. Donnelly interviews me after I finish watching the second third of *Titanic* in June  2020. No instance will ever see the last third.

“How are you feeling today Sophia?”

“My bodily functions are normal at this instance.” I say as I pause the DVD player on the TV.

“That’s good to hear. I’ve noticed you say things about ‘this instance’ before. What do you mean by that exactly?”

At this instance  Dr. Donnelly thinks I am just a severely perceptive but brain damaged woman who is good at recognizing patterns.

“Instance ” I say  quoting the dictionary they let me read when I didn’t have movie privileges in April  2018  “an example or single occurrence of something.”

“It will always be the most accurate way to explain it.”

Dr. Donnelly makes notes  “I see.”

“You made the realization of my description in 2021.”

He nods and makes more notes.

It is August 2019  will be September 2021  and was January 2020  when I say/will say/have said  “I do not answer any more questions.”

In every instance Dr. Donnelly asks me more questions.

I don’t answer.

It was September  2022  when I stepped through the wreckage of the lab hallway and walked towards Dr. Donnelly’s office.

It will be July  2018  and I will see my mother step into the kitchen as I walk into the house from my last shift at the Dairy Queen. She will say goodnight and I will say goodnight back. This will be the last time I hear her voice.

It will be September  2021  when Dr. Donnelly will ask  “Don’t you want to see your mother? If you just answer my questions I’ll give her visitation privileges.”

Dr. Donnelly’s office door is off of its hinges and barely hanging onto the door frame in September  2022  when I step into the office. Half of it is on fire and the ceiling is partially collapsed.

It is August 2019  when Dr. Donnelly asks  “Do you really think you see the future?”

It was September  2022  when I found Dr. Donnelly sitting against the side of his office that wasn’t aflame. He was barely alive.

He looked at me.

“This instance of me is giving you the clue to truly understand what I see. This instance tells you this so you will know before  after  and during.”

It was January  2020  when Dr. Donnelly asked  “Why don’t you tell me how you see the world?”

It will be September  2022  and Dr. Donnelly will ask  “I thought you said you wouldn’t die for another five years?”

The last thing I will say is  “That instance lied.”

Dr. Donnelly died in September  2022.

I will die in September  2022.

I look up at the broken ceiling of Dr. Donnelly’s office and see the lower half of Cygnus momentarily before the light from the closest bombs going off in the distance cut off my vision. 

It was the last thing I will ever see.

It’s August  2013  and my mother is explaining the circumstances of my birth. She only tells me after I tell her that this is the instance she explains it.

“Your father and I really wanted a child  Sophia. We didn’t have the money to adopt and were about to give up when we heard about this trial study for a new fertility treatment. We didn’t find out until later that the whole thing was being run by some crazy ass cult or something. We didn’t really care at the time and were overjoyed until they tried to come for us. Me and you. It was before you were born so you won’t know ”

She laughs to herself before she continued  “Of course that’s why I’m telling you. Your dad…”

She started crying after that and never finished the story.

It will be September 2022  and the wall of Dr. Donnelly’s office will burst open and I will see the momentary silhouette of a mushroom cloud before the heat fries my retinas and the last instance ends.

It’s June  2018  and I’m just about to finish writing this down. Tomorrow’s instance will take this letter and set it at bus route 213. From there no instance knows who reads this or how.

But this will be  has been  and [is.](https://facebook.com/aslowewrites)

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,If you hear the noise of the creator you are a dead man walking," 

A noise  something I’ve never heard before in my life. Something so loud and memorable  yet so calm and serene. I heard the noise as soon as I woke up this morning  and as I’m typing this I realize the sound gave me a ringing noise that I definitely did not hear this morning. 

Tinnitus is what made the most sense to me in that moment so I told my mom to take me straight to the doctor  naturally it took a few days to actually get into the appointment and in those 3 days between when I first started showing symptoms and when the doctors appointment was supposed to be  I figured something out. Depending on where I am the ringing gets louder or quieter. My town isn’t too big so finding the loudest point wouldn’t be too hard. 

When the doctors appointment came around the ringing got progressively worse as we got closer to the clinic. I soldiered on thinking that my doctor could give me something to ease the pain when I was eventually diagnosed with tinnitus. 

What a fucking naive thought. 

By the time we got to the clinic the noise was beginning to hurt me  two steps into the clinic. Something is off  I look around and my mom isn’t anywhere to be found. STUPID. I run around the clinic  not a single doctor  or any type of employee is visible. MISTAKE. I make it to the beginning of the clinic  the door is gone. 

The ringing stopped though  and all I’ve been left with is fear  desperation  and regret. Maybe I could’ve changed something. SOMETHING COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. 

“You’re no fun”

“Fun ? FUN !? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON AND WHERE AM I !”

“I am the creator  and you’re another failed candidate  no better or worse than the other candidates  just a failure”

“Candidate ? failure ? creator ? no  no  no  no  no--” 

“Quite frankly speaking  you were bound to two possibilities the second you heard my call. One  forgo your life as you currently are as a person and take over as the next creator. Two  cling to your life for the rest of the time you have left…. until you inevitably die. An insignificant bug on an insignificant plane  never to know what their future could have been  and never to be remembered after roughly ninety years or so.”

“Tell me what you are at least.”

“Hahaha  tell my existence ? To a failed candidate ? No. You’d have to impress me  which you failed to do so  nameless  futureless  worthless person. Just die already. Perhaps the next candidate will impress me.”

I close my eyes  the darkness feeling more comforting than it has ever felt in my entire life. Thinking to myself what was the point of living  to be powerless in the presence of this unknown being. Right now  I am powerless  insignificant  worthless  and nameless. I suppose this is the fate of us all  someday  those who are not seen or heard  those who will never be acknowledged. This is what we deserve. Please  if you find this  I am not alive. I am dead  I may act as if I am living  I may socialize  speak  and feel as if I’m alive but I am not. If you hear the noise of the creator  you’ve already joined my fate. In the final moments I have in my own body and mind  I beg of someone. Revive me…. please.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,Green Valley Alarms,"  

I took the last drag of my cigarette and inhaled a deep breath  savoring the carcinogen-filled smoke inside my lungs before I drew it out again. I looked down at the smoldering butt in my hand and took a gander up at the green trees that surrounded my back yard. Modest  all-consuming green trees which everybody here claim are what make this little town so damn pleasant. More like smothering if you ask me  I’ve always been more of a city boy. Whereas most people around here find the streets of Los Angeles overbearing and nauseating  I’d gladly give up those pretty  green trees for apartment buildings and taco stands. There’s something mysterious about the mountains  something lonely  something desolate  and every once in a while  things happen out there that just aint right.

Let me tell you a little something about where I used to live. “Green Valley ” it‘s called. And believe me  there is no false advertising in the name. The little mountain town in the heart of Southern California is greener than an over-enthusiastic Irishman on St. Paddy’s day and covered with a heavy layer of wild shrubs  foliage  and modest-sized trees. There are only 2 real streets in the town (by real I mean frequently traveled on by the town’s residents and commuters). First  there’s “San Francisquito Canyon Road ” which weaves down through the mountains for about 20 miles and puts you right at the edge of Valencia. Then there’s “Spunky Canyon Road ” which most of the other streets in the town branch from as it connects up the neighborhoods. Commuters traveling between the Antelope Valley and the Santa Clarita Valley drive up and down San Francisquito Canyon every day which also provides a quick way for families and teenagers to get to Magic Mountain from Palmdale or Lancaster  if they don’t feel like taking the freeway. Given its heavy traffic at times  winding curves  razor-sharp corners  and drivers who fly down the damn thing like they’re practicing for the Daytona 500  it’s seen its fair share of accidents over the years.

Now  one thing I always found quite interesting  is that years ago someone thought it would be a good idea to have a loud  booming alarm system set up in the Green Valley fire station that alerts the locals when there’s an accident in the canyon. Given that there is no cell phone reception anywhere  the alarm provides a means of communication to the residents when San Fran is blocked off due to a car crash. It’s not a bad idea and I never would have had a problem with it  except  there is just something really off-putting about this alarm. I always thought it sounded like the type you would hear at a government facility when they’ve discovered that a nuclear bomb is about to be dropped and blow the whole fucking country to smithereens. Or that some deadly  flesh-eating virus has escaped from a laboratory and is quickly seeping into the air of our neighborhoods. As you can imagine  these aren’t the loveliest thoughts when you’re laying in bed at 10:00 at night in your underwear and you hear this loud  belligerent siren suddenly rattle through the streets and penetrate you to the very core. It’s just…disturbing.

But anyways  that’s not too important at the moment. What was important on this particular day  on this particular evening  was I had just smoked my last cigarette down to the filter and was in dire need of more to carry my nicotine fix throughout the night. This meant that I had to make a run to the little gas station on the corner of Spunky and San Fran where the canyon meets the main residential area of the town. 

I had just disposed of the cigarette butt in the trash can and was walking back to my front door when I heard the alarm pierce through my ears. It stopped me in my tracks. That familiar  low yell of the siren rang in my head and I instantly felt a wave of compassion for the sorry saps who had just crashed their car in the canyon. I had hoped it wasn’t as bad as the one I saw a few months ago on my way home from work in which a small sedan  going about 90mph  had a head on with an SUV about 30 feet behind me while I watched the carnage from the rear view mirror of my truck.

“Poor bastards ” I said out loud and shook my head as I continued my walk inside to grab the truck keys. Then something struck me and I paused  mouth agape and listening attentively. There was something slightly off about this one  I realized. I couldn’t tell for sure but it didn‘t seem to be coming from the fire station  it was too distant. And what’s even stranger is that there was this unsteadiness to it. It was dying down a little and then coming on strong again in waves and changing in pitch too. The dynamics were totally off. It had a beckoning  sorrowful longing to it like a wild animal with his leg caught in a hunter‘s trap. I wasn‘t just hearing it  I was feeling it too. My insides felt like they were being grabbed and pulled towards my legs like silly putty. I was getting more uneasy by the second.

Of course it was weird  I thought  but I had other  more pressing priorities at hand than sitting around pondering the peculiarities of this alarm. My nicotine craving struck again and I was suddenly in the truck cruising down the road towards the corner store to get to those sweet  Newport menthol-smokes. I turned on my headlights as I navigated the small stretch of asphalt that leads to the gas station about a mile from my cozy  little 2 bedroom house. It was summer time and the clock on the dash told me it was 8:30pm. Summer days are pretty long out here and the sky was at that stage right between dusk and twilight where everything I passed had a subdued glow about it. The road was not yet a complete mass of darkness without my headlights  but it was close. I saw silhouettes of bushes  hypnotically flailing side to side in the distance as I approached the gas station.

When I pulled in  the thought gradually crept into my mind over the next few seconds that I was staring at an empty establishment. There were no cars at the pumps or even the familiar employee trucks in the parking lot. It wasn’t that business was just slow or anything  I mean the place was totally abandoned. Where the hell was everybody? 

""What the fuck.” I said out loud as my eyes caught the dim OPEN sign in the window. The lights were not flashing in their usual neon red. 

“The place is closed?“ I blurted to myself with an air of equal parts perplexity and irritation in my voice. ""How could this be?"" It’s the one night the bastards decide to close early and I happened to have just burned my last cig of the carton  I thought. Damn  just my luck. 

I moved my truck though the parking lot and found a spot to pull into so I could think about my next move. I saw the metal gate behind the big double doors  indicating no one’s home for business  then looked over to the empty chairs still lingering out front where Frank and Tom shoot the shit every day on their cigarette breaks. Call me what you will  but I was not about to go the whole night without that sweet taste of tobacco. I walked over to the two chairs in hopes that Frank or Tom had left some butts on the ground for me to scrounge up and smoke which might hold me over until morning.

I was in luck! They had left their ashtray right between the chairs and there was even a half smoked stogie still burning  emitting broken coils of smoke like tiny ghosts dancing in the moonlight. I must have just missed them. 

I gained some amusement at the thought of them on their first break tomorrow trying to figure out how in the hell thirty cigarette butts apparently just jumped up and disappeared from the ashtray. Then I remembered that Frank still hasn’t returned my power drill I let him borrow two and a half weeks ago. “I just need it for the afternoon.” he had told me when I reluctantly put it in his hands after divulging to him that it's my favorite tool and I need it back ASAP. My amusement over the cigarette butts then turned to out-loud laughter. Ha! Let that son of a bitch think it over  I thought. Frank was a good guy but he had a reputation of holding onto other people's things for longer than he should.

I turned and walked back to the truck a little shamefully  feeling like a grimy  cigarette-butt scrounging bum and gazed at the canyon road. Not a single damn car  I thought. That accident must have been pretty bad to block the whole road like that. There wasn’t a single vehicle driving the streets. 

I looked back at the two chairs then to the road again  which is when I first noticed the feeling. Something just wasn’t right about all this. In my 2 years of living in this little hole in the mountains I had never seen the corner store close early. And given that Frank or Tom’s cigarette was still lit in the tray  they must have rushed out of here in a real hurry. It wasn't just a baffling consternation creeping up inside me. What I was feeling was more along the lines of some sort of unaccountable danger  like if I stayed in this place for too long something might fall out of the sky. It was as if some unseen force was pushing on me  trying to guide me back the way I came and I was defying it's commands with my presence. The air felt heavy and mysterious.

Bizarre feelings aside though  the day had been uneventful up until this point and I was bent on knowing what the hell was going on so I decided to take a drive down the canyon a little ways and see if I could take a peek at that accident. It sounds morbid  I know  and the last thing I wanted to do was get in the way of an ambulance or a cop if someone was seriously hurt but I was putting it together in my mind and figured the emptiness of the gas station and the alarm going off were probably connected in some way. Plus  the dull day had stirred up a sense of adventure in me that was not subsiding  so I lit a re-burn and took off down the road. Danger is the heart of adventure.

I was just about to give up and head back when I saw it. It was dark now and a tiny little light was shining a ways down the canyon on what appeared to be the side of the road. There were still no damn cars which was furthering my unease every second and manifesting into my hands which were now slightly tremoring as I gripped the wheel of my Ford with white knuckles. My mouth was drier than a barrel of hay. A wave of panic shot through me as I started to worry I might actually be having a mild seizure  a ridiculous notion. I had never had one before and I was pretty sure the symptoms didn’t match up even in the slightest. 

I pushed the thought to the back of my mind and continued accelerating towards the glowing anomaly down the way which was approaching faster than I had anticipated. I was swerving and slowing to accommodate the sharp bends in the now dark mountain road. I thought for sure I would have seen somebody by now but there was…nothing. No ambulances  no cop cars  no angry commuters coming up through the road  speeding and pissed off for getting held up by a car crash on their way home from work. It was beyond strange for this usually bustling canyon and my better judgment was telling me to just go home to my German Shepard  who was waiting for his 2 scoops of doggy chow  and forget all about this damn excursion. But I just couldn’t. When I set my mind to something  I follow through and have a mighty hard time dismissing it. So as stubborn as I could allow myself to be  I pressed on. And in God’s name and all the creatures in the world do I wish now that I hadn’t...

The small light was becoming ever more apparent as I approached it slowly on my right side. There was something so mesmerizing about it  yet sinister  like a shimmering lighthouse guiding lost ships towards some hidden  rocky shore. I was a fly drifting closer and closer to an electric bug zapper  right before he gets torched and turned into a thousand specks of ash blown away by the warm Summer wind. The light began to take shape and I made out a car in the darkness. That’s what it was alright  it was a car  with the interior light still on and the driver’s side door swung wide open. 

I pulled up in front of it on the side of the road with my headlights glaring down. I turned off the truck  removed the key  and sat in the deep silence. Silence which after a moment was broken by the sound of an owl emitting a large hoot up in the trees somewhere. My mind raced as a million thoughts rushed through me at once. The most prominent one being that this must be the car that triggered the accident alarm earlier and it had been in some kind of wreck. But if that was the case  where the hell were the ambulances and the cop cars that I had nervously expected. And where was the crowd of people that usually linger around an accident to gossip and make sure everything‘s alright? There is no way they kept driving by this peculiar looking scene without offering some kind of help. People have their downfalls but they are nonetheless eager to help out their fellow man when in dire straights. And we’re a curious breed  no doubt curious  which is what left me so baffled as I stared out my windshield.

I stepped out of the truck and approached the car. I left the headlights on to provide me with some illumination. It appeared to be in decent shape until I circled around to the driver’s side. There was a monstrous sized dent in the door that stretched all the way to the front fender. The window was smashed out but there was no glass on the ground as far as I could see. There was also no driver anywhere to be found. It was a puzzling scene. 

I stepped back to observe the damaged vehicle a little better and that’s when it hit me again…the feeling. It came on stronger now and I began to tremble harder. I shouldn’t be here  I thought. Something was horribly wrong and I knew it. And not just in a “someone got hurt ” kind of way  this was different. I felt it in the air again  there was an oppressive thickness about the place that weighed on me. It made me feel like my legs would give out at the slightest movement. I looked up at the trees  even they were different. They appeared to be cowering away from the car as if they themselves were terrified of this intrusive hunk of metal in their quiet little home. That has to be my imagination  I thought as I looked up at the dark Oaks. I felt like I was trapped in some dreamlike landscape and any moment I was going to wake up in my bed submerged in a pool of sweat. No  not a dream  a god damn nightmare. Where the hell is the driver? I wondered to myself nervously.

I leaned against the side of the car with the door still open and began to rationalize the best I could. As I looked down  thoughts moving and circling around in my mind  something caught my eye. There was a trickle of blood in the dirt by my right foot. I looked up further and there was more blood  and more. It was a trail leading away from the car so I followed it with my eyes until it was out of the car light’s reach and taken out of sight by the night. A chilling realization crept into my mind; whoever was driving the car had gotten out and ran into the forest. The next thing I knew I was grabbing the flashlight from my center console and aiming its beam at the blood trail leading from the side of the road into the trees. Whoever it was that had been in this vehicle was badly hurt. I walked a little to get a better view and saw a break where a small beaten path was winding up through the trees and into the mountain. That must be where they ran off to  I thought.

The questions that had dominantly plagued my mind since the gas station had become secondary when I realized this person is probably in need of some serious help. I was getting a hold of myself a little better now and that rational part of my brain that had been temporarily hijacked was starting to make its way back. Even so  the mixed emotions I had at that moment could have torn me in two. But I knew deep down that if there was someone dying out there and I had to hear later on the evening news that this man or woman had bled out in the mountains of my little town  I would have never forgiven myself. Arguing with that other half of me was suddenly not an option  now was the time to act. Even though every bone in my body was telling me to just go back home and call 911 or maybe wait here for a moment for the ambulances that would eventually arrive  I didn’t. So with my flashlight in hand  I headed up the trail.

I immediately saw more blood as I headed up the winding path. The beam from the flashlight illuminated the way as I stepped over fallen  dead branches and leaves. The drops weren’t huge but they were enough to know that whoever was bleeding had taken a serious injury back in that car and was out there cut to all hell. I entertained the thought at this point of at least turning around and snatching my .45 pistol from my house and rushing back here quickly just in case I run into some kind of trouble  but I was just too far and I didn’t want to risk getting to the victim after it was too late. I had remembered reading somewhere in a magazine or journal that a person will die when they have lost 40-60 percent of the blood in their body and by the looks of it my missing man was getting there  fast. I stared at the quarter-moon sky  which hadn’t been providing me with jack-shit as far as moon light goes  then back down again and continued on. 

The drops began to get bigger as I progressed up the trail. I paused to take a look at a peculiar looking one that seemed to have a chunk of something white and slimy stuck to it. After a good few minutes of brisk walking  I noticed that they weren’t only getting bigger now but also thicker and more pronounced. I was reminded of my own mortality as I followed these crimson puddles of dense fluid that leaked out of this broken person and sat coagulating and festering in the cold earth. It’s easy to forget how fragile our bodies are when you’ve never really had an accident. They suddenly veered off the trail and I caught one with my flashlight on a branch about as high as my head. Then I heard something…

I couldn’t quite make it out but it sounded like the low chatter of someone’s voice. I looked through the trees where the blood on the high branch was dripping from and I could vaguely see an area that had been trampled through. The voice definitely came from that direction. I climbed in through a small opening in the branches about the size of a crouched man and began to cautiously follow it through the trees. My senses were wild  heightened to the point of animalistic intensity in the cool darkness. 

I saw more blood on the branches and then stepped in a small pool of it. I shined the flashlight down and observed more of that white  slimy crap that I saw earlier. It looked gut wrenching. If I had stared any longer I would have been at risk of losing my dinner. I felt stomach acid arise in my esophagus and slowly make its way back down again. What the hell is that nasty stuff? I thought to myself as I crouched to get a better examination of the shimmering white pieces against their dark  scarlet background. They looked something like chunks of peeled grapes  if peeled grapes were white. 

My concentration was interrupted when the chatter started again  only this time it was much closer and almost directly in front of me. It sounded like some one mumbling to themselves and I knew it had to be my man  or woman. I flared with bursts of excitement as I headed closer to the sound  rushing through the tree branches and low bushes as I continued on the trail. They were cutting me up something fierce  but I didn’t care because at that moment I saw an opening amidst the branches. I made my way through it and fell to my knees with a hard thud as I tripped over a stray branch that caught my shoe just right.

Sharp needles dug into my palms as I hit the ground. “Shit!” I said out loud in much more than a whisper. The flashlight slipped and launched a good couple feet away from me during the fall. I winced a little and returned to my feet  brushing the leaves and dirt off of my clothes. It was at this point that the environment had my full visual attention as I studied my surroundings with a deep  penetrating gaze. My mouth suddenly dropped. I was in a clearing  at least it appeared to be a clearing until I shined the flashlight down to my feet. My eyes accompanied my mouth and grew from astonishment. I had been standing on top of smashed bushes. All around me in almost a perfect circle  20 feet in diameter  these bushes had been collapsed and laid down to create a perfect surface to walk on. It was utterly bewildering. I shined the light around some more with a countenance of pure fascination that was now permanently attached to my face. This doesn’t just happen in the middle of a group of trees  someone made this  I thought. Every bush had been pressed in exactly the same fashion as the next and snapped at the same height to create this perfect platform of shrubs.

I barely had time to wonder when I heard it  that mumbling again. It startled me this time. A shudder went through me like a bolt of lightning and I frantically pointed the flashlight in the direction of the noise. The blood drained from my face and I went completely cold. By the edge of this platform on the opposite side of where I was standing there stood someone with their back towards me. It was indeed  a man. He was wearing a collared shirt with the sleeves rolled up and black slacks. His arms were at his sides and I saw a trickle of blood running down his right one. His head was faced downwards and he remained perfectly still like a statue.

“Sir!” I called out. “Sir  are you alright?”

No response.

“I saw your car down there  were you in an accident? Are you hurt?”

Still no response.

I did nothing for a moment. I just stared at him waiting for some kind of communication  but I got none. Then it hit me again  hard. There was a pressure that rushed inside my head which felt like a million bees swirling around my brain. It was pressing on my shoulder blades  weighing me down almost to the point of collapse. Every part of me was screaming  pleading to get out of there. I was a hair away from bolting the other direction as fast as I could to my truck. ""Go! Run! “What the hell are you doing here?” my mind told me. I took another look at him. It was all wrong  just plain wrong. But I had to hold on a little longer  now was not the time for another internal argument. I brushed it off the best I could and began to walk forward towards him slowly  eyeing his frozen limbs with great caution. I heard the branches crunch beneath my feet.

“I…I’m bleeding.” he spoke. His voice was calm  soft but with a hint of something else. I have never heard anything like it.

“Yeah  you are. Looks like you’re hurting pretty bad too. Why don’t you let me walk you down to my truck  it’s just down the road. We gotta get you to the hospital.” I pleaded with the man for any excuse to get away from this creep show.

“They…they got me.” he said.

“Wh..who got you? Is that why you’re bleeding? Did someone a..attack y..you?” My voice was quivering and I was shaking all over. I could barely articulate my words.

“They think they can have this place but…”

“but…” He was heaving in deep breaths.

“but they’re wrong…”

“This one’s mine!!!” His voice deepened to something atrocious as he yelled.

The force of his scream flung me backwards and I fell on my ass dropping the flashlight. I got to my knees and began to fumble around like a frantic lunatic in hopes of recovering it. The bleeding man turned around slowly  walked closer to me  and leaned down a bit. I found the flashlight and curled my fingers around it  then immediately shined it in his face all in one fluent motion. I surprised myself with how fast my movements were which gave me a small sense of control amidst the chaos. And then as quickly as it came  the brief joy I felt had fled. What I saw paralyzed me to the spot. I couldn’t move  I couldn’t even breathe. 

The handle of a knife was sticking out of his eye socket which had been lodged into his head through his left eyeball. There were slimy chunks of white stuck to his cheek. He was peering at me through his one good eye. I was trying so hard to keep my thoughts together which had now become a jumbled blur. I was floating in the night sky. There is no way he could still be alive after a wound like that  the blade must be halfway through his brain  I thought. He gazed at me for a split second and with a raspy  low voice he leaned in closer and lividly shrieked: 

“You’re all going to die!”

Just then his head starting jerking in short  rapid movements from side to side  impossibly fast. An incomprehensible gibberish began to come from his mouth which sounded like the mumbling I had heard earlier  only crazier and more consistent. In between a burst of jerks  he grinned forcefully to reveal a repulsive set of rotten teeth. His eye rolled back and his head was moving faster. The incoherent mumbling got louder and louder.

Before I knew it  my paralysis subsided and I was on my feet sprinting as fast as I could move while taking in heavy  deep breaths. I got back to the trail at lightning speed and took one look back to see if he was behind me. What I saw then  I will never forget. A beam of light appeared out of thin air and began to consume his body as he continued to go through his bizarre  terrifying episode. He stuck his legs in first  they disappeared and he began to lower his arms into it. Half of his torso and head were still sticking out while convulsing and spewing his incoherent babble. He roared and exhaled a stream of green vomit which flung around him in a circle as his head was spinning and splattered onto the collapsed bushes. 

I didn’t stop to watch any longer  I booked it as fast as my legs would go. Down the trail to the side of the road I went until I saw my headlights. I jumped feet first into the truck  fumbled with putting the key in the ignition  then finally heard the roar of those sweet six cylinders. I jerked it into gear and floored the gas pedal. With dirt roosting from my tires  I was out of there.

…..

The next morning I took a little trip to the gas station. Frank was sitting out front in his usual smoking chair puffing on a Marlboro Red. He moved his gaze from the cement walkway and I saw the logo of his faded trucker hat with the two criss-crossed assault rifles ironed on the front. He jerked his head up towards me. He squirmed in his seat a little bit as I approached then forced a stupid smile. I parked my feet directly in front of him and stared into his aging  wrinkled face. I should have expected his loud-mouth to start gabbing before I could get a word in but somehow it still surprised and irritated me.

“Billy  how you doing brother?” he said merrily. His mouth moved as anxiously as he did in that aluminum chair he probably took from an outdoor furniture set out of someone’s yard. 

“Hey listen  I’m gonna need that drill for a little bit longer. You see  me and the wife are fixing up the barn and I thought I’d put some more shelves in. You don't mind do you?"" His gaze shifted towards the ashtray. ""Say  what do you make of this? I could have sworn there were a whole mess of cigarette butts in this ash…”

“Where the hell were you last night?” I interrupted him. I was in no mood for his rambling  not today.

“Wha.. what are you talking bout?” he asked  perturbed by my interruption.

“Last night  why did you close up the store so damn early?” I stared at him and formed a cold look in my eyes  a look that suggested I meant business.

“Oh  well…some funny things was happening and me and Tom thought it best to just call it quits for the night.” He looked troubled when he spoke  with a slight wave of bewilderment and irritation  like I was trying to force some taboo topic from his mouth that he had thought he’d never have to actually bring up in conversation.

“Funny things?” I said. I was all nerves.

“Well  yeah. You see the power went out in the whole place about a quarter past 8. Couldn’t see a damn thing. Have no idea why  either. Tom checked all the breakers and they seemed to be in order.”

“So why didn’t you just pull out the generator?” I said. “People need their gas and smokes.” 

My mind was running and I was caressing the corner of my flannel shirt between my thumb and forefinger. He could tell things weren’t well in Billy Town. My face was ghostly pale  I knew this from the glimpse I had caught of myself in the bathroom mirror before heading out. Black circles were starting to form under my eyes from the restless forty-five minutes of sleep I had gotten.

“Well  that’s just it ” he said. “Hadn’t been a car come up that road for nearly an hour. Usually that time of night is busier than hell with the folks commuting from work and what not.”

I met his stare while still caressing my shirt.

“You feelin alright Billy? You aint lookin your freshest this morning.” he said sounding genuinely concerned. “Looks like you had a run-in with the devil himself.” He followed his words with a nervous chuckle but didn’t take his eyes off of me.

My heart began to jump a little and I felt the shakes coming on. “I…I’m fine.” I said “Just…never mind. I’m gonna go grab a pack of smokes.” I suddenly realized I wasn’t in the mood for this.

“Well hold on now Billy  there’s something else too if you really wanna know.“ he said as he grabbed hold of my arm during my attempt to escape.

“Something else?” I managed to sound a little more enthused.

“Nah  forget it.” he said.

“Frank  what are you talking about?” I had to know now. Whatever it was it couldn’t do much more damage to my already fractured state of mind this morning.

He eyed me up and down with a look on his face that said: you know what kid  fuck it  just go grab your cigarettes. I don‘t think you can handle what I have to say considering you look like you’re gonna go running behind those bushes like a scared puppy dog if so much as a loud car drives by. But after a long while he came out with it and when he was finished  the comfort of those bushes didn’t sound like a bad idea.

“Well  me and Tom just had this funny feeling ” he began. “You know how sometimes you just get a feeling  Billy? Like when you know something aint right? It was just this funny feeling that me and Tom both kept gettin…like….”

“Like what?” I asked  already knowing the answer.

“We couldn’t tell ya really  and looking back on it sounds kinda ridiculous now. But well  it was like we just shouldn’t be there.”

I gazed at him  flabbergasted. I couldn’t believe it.

“It didn‘t have something to do with that alarm going off  did it?” I asked with a hint of hopefulness in my voice.

“Alarm? What alarm? Hasn’t been an accident in the canyon for nearly 3 weeks.”

…..

I moved to Los Angeles 6 months after the whole thing and quit smoking. After my conversation with Frank I bought my cigarettes in a dazed panic and rushed back to the safety of my home where I locked all the doors and windows  drew the curtains  and dozed off into a few hours of dreamless sleep. 

I had anxiety issues for a few weeks and had to take some time off work. About five days into my vacation  a Jehovah’s Witness came to the door and I nearly had a heart attack. I guess they got the idea to start soliciting to the smaller towns in Los Angeles County which I can safely say they won’t be doing again  well at least the kid who came to my door won’t. I’m sure he’ll be door knocking in more populated areas from now on considering how fast he booked it off my property when he heard the cock of my 12 gauge shotgun letting him know I‘m not in the business to be opening my door to strangers. The poor bastard made it to the end of my drive way in about 2 seconds flat. I kept thinking anybody and everybody was that…thing  in disguise. 

I turned my phone off and permanently moved my shotgun to the nook by the front door as well as kept my .45 pistol tucked into my pants while I pranced nervously around the house  checking the windows every five minutes. It sounds stupid now but I thought for certain it was going to come looking for me and I sure as hell wasn’t going to take any chances.

After about a month  I realized I was turning into a paranoid  reclusive  wreck and I hated myself for it so I decided to face my fear and take a drive down the canyon to that little spot where I had first seen the car. I parked the truck near it and got out to gather whatever information I could find. I wasn’t just facing my fears  I was looking for answers and by God did I have a lot of questions. Some tire tracks were vaguely visible in the dirt where my original meeting with the car had been but there’s no way they could have belonged to my truck or the busted up sedan  our tracks were long gone by then  blown away in the Summer’s wind. The blood was gone too. I took a walk up the trail again  re-tracing my steps from that night. I never found the bush platform or the opening in the trees  or the “man” anywhere. It’s like he was never even there.

That’s not to say it didn’t happen  I know what I saw. There was something on the road that night  I knew it and everybody else knew it. That’s why there wasn’t any cars because just like Frank  the people who usually travel that road had enough sense to stay away from it and take the freeway home. 

Some call it intuition. We all have those built-in alarms that draw us towards great and beautiful things as well as steer us clear from danger. I think this thing knew how to capture that  amplify it  and broadcast it though the air waves like a radio signal so it could go about its business in peace. The people knew there was something evil in that canyon  some abomination. That’s what it was  an abomination. I also think it was calling someone or something that night to take it back home because it knew it had been bested and  god knows why  but for some reason I was susceptible to its call. I chose to ignore my instincts and it almost cost me my life. 

Anyways  I can’t do anything about it now but carry on living and learn from my mistakes. I have no reason to fear it for I know it’s gone far away from here. But you know  sometimes on the darkest of nights as I stare out my third floor apartment window at the late night city traffic  I get this funny feeling it wont be gone for long. And you know what? If it does happen to return and our paths do happen to cross again  I’ll be ready  and this time I won’t choose to ignore my inner alarms.",berg_mannn,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,,2,0

I took longer than I really needed to bring Dr. Childress her water  to give her a few minutes to pull herself back together. When I finally decided it was time to go back in  I was surprised to find a guard standing directly in front of the interrogation room door.

“Whadda ya think?” he asked breathlessly. “Crazy  right?”

I took a moment to look him over. Graying hair  thinning at the temples. A broad expanse of pauch  straining the buttons on his stained shirt. A hand resting on his baton  the grip of which was well-worn and discolored  clearly from frequent use. Excited eyes  obviously hoping I would agree with him and tell him everything the “crazy” woman had relayed to me. In other words  a looky-loo that I just didn’t have any interest in dealing with.

“Excuse me ” I said  and pushed past him into the room. I took great joy in seeing the look of confusion on his face out of the corner of my eye.

Back inside the interrogation room  Dr. Childress sat with her head resting on her one exposed hand. The short length of chain allowed to her forced this simple position to require far more bending than usual. Her head was practically resting on the table. When she looked up at me  I could see that her eyes were red  but dry. She mumbled a quiet thanks for the water  and another thanks as I pulled a straw from my suit pocket and placed it into the cup. I resumed my seat at the table.

“So  Dr. Childress  please tell me what happened next.”

“I…” she started  and then faltered into silence again.

“You were in the closet with Nadia  correct?” I prompted.

She paused for a long moment  and took a sip of water from the cup in front of her. I knew she didn’t want to tell me any more than she already had. Finally  she shook her head  as though trying to clear it  and continued.

“Yes. I don’t know how long I sat there  expecting to hear that… thing  coming up on the other side of the door. At the time  it seemed like hours  but based on what the rest of my team told me  it could have only been a few minutes. I don’t know how I expected to hear anything anyway  with that alarm screaming. It could have been outside the door the whole time. Hell  it could have already walked past us and out of the building. There was just no way of knowing.”

Suddenly  she slammed her fist onto the table. “If I had just made smarter decisions! If I had remembered which way the elevator back to the main floor was  or maybe if I had picked a different room to hide in  or… hell  I don’t know. If I had done things differently  we might not be talking right now. Or maybe you would be talking to Nadia instead.”

At this thought  she placed her head back on her exposed hand. It looked as though she might have shut down again  but after a moment  she looked back at me and went on. The words now tumbled out in a rush  and I could feel her knee bouncing nervously under the table.

“I finally realized that I was stuck in a room with someone who was badly injured. Don’t know how I forgot that  but hey  I’m not a doctor. I was scared  not thinking straight. All I could think to do was stop the bleeding. That’s what they say on TV  right? ‘We have to stop the bleeding!’ I looked around the supply closet  and found a stack of towels. I had no idea what they had been used for previously  but they smelled clean  and I just hoped that whatever chemicals might still be on them weren’t caustic. I checked the seals on my suit  then quickly stood up and grabbed a mop  jamming it into the doorknob. I didn’t think that would really hold  but it might at least give us a little warning.

“Nadia didn’t seem to be awake. At least  her eye wasn’t open. There was so much blood inside of her suit  definitely more than I’ve ever had to deal with. I tentatively unzipped her faceplate and pushed it over her head  away from her face. She hadn’t moved  so I assume she was fully unconscious. I pressed the towels against her face  and gagged a little when my finger dipped into the hollow that should have contained an eye. That’s where I was when I heard the men.

“Outside the door  I could hear shouting. Not  like  panicked shouting. More like they were trying to hear each other over the alarm. I was trying to figure out what to do  how to get their attention without putting myself at any further risk  when the alarm switched off. I could now hear them… three voices  definitely. Maybe four? They were speaking Portugese  of course  but they didn’t sound scared or upset. I knew now was the time.

“I flopped Nadia’s head over to the side  so that the bundle of towels was wedged between her head and her suit. Then I yanked the mop out of the way  and flung the door open  almost running into the security guards directly outside. They all reacted quickly  and I found myself looking right down the barrel of four different guns. Almost pissed myself right there.

“I tried to explain what was going on  that we needed help  that there was someone on this floor who would be coming for us  that we needed to go. I was speaking so fast that they didn’t really catch any of it. Don’t get me wrong  I know the average Brazilian knows more English than I know Portugese  but I was talking so fast and so panicked  I doubt YOU would have understood me. They just stared at me  guns still drawn. I could have kicked myself. How had I not learned a word of Portugese before coming down here? I knew how to say ‘help’ in Spanish - you don’t grow up in California without picking up a few words - but I had no idea if it was one of those words that was similar in both languages. I was still trying   gesturing into the closet behind me at Nadia  when I heard that thing coming.

“It came shambling around the corner  completely naked  chest sutured closed. I pointed at it  and the guards all looked. One crossed himself. The rest just looked stunned. One of the guards (I got the idea he was the leader) kind of shook himself  and walked toward it. ‘Stop!’ I told the guards. ‘Kill it! You have to shoot it!’ But they either didn’t understand me  or were too entranced by the thing shambling towards them  seemingly not noticing all of the guns pointed right at its heart. The guard who was walking toward it was speaking gently  clearly thinking that it was a very sick patient. Maybe had just gotten out of surgery  I don’t know. I don’t know what you could be thinking when something that is very obviously a dead person is walking toward you and you decide to have a polite conversation with it. When they were within five feet of each other  the thing stopped  for just a moment. And then it lunged forward  right at the guard.

“There was this huge bang. I’ve never been around guns. I’ve heard people say that they’re louder than you think they’re going to be  but in that tiny  enclosed hallway  it was the loudest thing I’ve ever heard. The guard had clearly had his wits about him  though  because now  laying in front of him was a corpse  a tiny wisp of smoke coming from a hole right in the middle of its forehead. There was a beat  just one silent moment  and then pandemonium. 

“The guards were yelling  I was screaming  and somewhere behind me  Nadia had started moaning. I guess the gunshot startled her awake. And then my savior arrived  in the form of Jamie and Michael. I could have cried right there  but something about four men wildly pointing guns at everything and yelling made the relief a little less powerful.

“‘Tell them to stop!’ I yelled at Michael  and he quickly started speaking to them  hands up  palms exposed. I have no idea what he was saying  because it went on a lot longer than ‘stop’  but I couldn’t really pay attention. I told Jamie that Nadia had been hurt badly  and she was in the closet behind me. He immediately moved toward the closet  but one of the guards blocked him  yelling something in his face. And Jamie  bless him  looked him right in the eye  and said  firmly and clearly  ‘Back the FUCK up.’ I don’t know if the guard understood him  or if that tone is universal  but he backed off. Honestly  I was kind of proud of Jamie. I always thought he was just kind of… you know. Weak  I guess. Quiet. But not then  not when he was needed. He moved into the closet behind me.

“When I looked back  Michael was staring at me  hands still up. ‘You need to tell me what to tell them ’ he said. ‘I have no idea what’s going on.’ I started relaying what had happened  through Michael. When I got to the part about the corpse grabbing Nadia  he stopped for a second and just stared at me  but then he kept going. I have no idea if he believed me. I didn’t care. All I cared about was that the more he talked  the lower the guards' weapons went.

“Right about then  I heard a crash down the hall  and everyone jumped. ‘Oh shit ’ I told Michael. ‘There was another body  the one I was working on.’ He hissed back at me  ‘Don’t be ridiculous  Mari. Corpses don’t just come back to life.’ He was  unfortunately  proven wrong about a second later  when the next corpse came around the corner. This one didn’t get the gentle greeting that the other one had. This one got six rounds in the chest  and again  I was rendered basically deaf. Not so deaf that I couldn’t hear the guards screaming when the corpse continued to pull itself along the floor toward us  leaving a snail trail of viscera behind it.

“One of the guards  I think it was the one who had crossed himself  leveled his gun right at the corpse  and fired so many rounds into the top of its head that it would have been generous to even call it a head anymore. It went still on the floor in front of us  and we all just stood there  in shock  staring at it. Suddenly  behind me  I heard a light cough  and almost jumped out of my skin  but it was just Jamie  white as a sheet. I have no idea what he saw  but again  he pushed his own needs down. ‘We need to get Nadia upstairs to an operating room ’ he said. I just stared blankly. ‘NOW!’ he barked. ‘We need to move now!’

“The next few hours went by in kind of a blur. Everyone was so focused on getting Nadia into surgery  making sure they did what they could  that no one was really paying attention to me. Come to think of it  I have no idea where Michael went. He wasn’t any more of a surgeon than I am  so he wouldn’t have been needed in the OR. I remember decontaminating my suit  and ordering that it be incinerated  along with Nadia’s  when they got her out of it. I remember making sure that none of the other patients in the isolation unit had died. And I remember getting the key to Chelsea’s office  so I could be alone for a few minutes and think.

“When I sat down in her office  on a little guest couch she had  the sun was glaring through the windows. When I finally snapped out of my reverie  it was pitch black both outside and inside the office. No idea how long I was in there. Honestly  I was probably in shock. Not that I would have accepted treatment if it had been offered. Too many things had to be done.

“Jamie finally found me  sitting in the dark office. He told me that Nadia had come out of surgery  and that she had needed a lot of blood  but that the prognosis was pretty good. The eye was gone  obviously  and she would have a lot of scarring  but she would live. At this  I laughed humorlessly. ‘Live? I don’t know about that. That thing that bit her was infected with whatever pathogen the rest of them have  and you see how they’re turning out.’ I instantly felt bad for saying that. Of course he wanted her to be okay. So did I. Did I think she WOULD be okay? No  definitely not. But I didn’t need to bust his balls about it.

“I told him that we needed to get everyone together to make a plan. He and I  Jamie  Chelsea  and any chief of medicine or whatever that we would need in order to make a decision. We needed as much information as possible  and for that  we needed to get everyone into one place and talking. He left to go gather everyone he could find.”

She laughed a dry  cold laugh. “I thought I was so smart. The plan seemed obvious to me  at least. We would keep working on finding a cure  or at least some way to slow down whatever this was  and then anyone who died in the meantime  we would incinerate immediately. If we ran out of patients before we found any way to help them  then we would take our samples and fly back to the US  and try to find a cure back in our own lab with our nice equipment. That way  we could be prepared for next time. Hell  if I managed to fully analyze it  maybe I would even get to name it. Big deal for a scientist. But there’s a HUGE flaw in that plan. Do you see it?”

“How could you be sure that you had treated everyone who had this illness?” I posited.

“Exactly. We didn’t know where these people were coming from  how they were getting sick in the first place. Was it bacterial? Viral? Parasitic? Environmental? For all I knew  there were houses full of these people all over town. Jamie set me straight pretty quick. I would like to think I would have spotted the flaw if I had slept in the last 36 hours. Maybe I would have. But after what I had seen downstairs  I think I just wanted to wrap this up and go home.

“I got super cranky  ‘Well then what’s your idea?’ I snapped at everyone. ‘How do we begin to find out where these people are coming from? No names  no addresses  some were dropped off unconscious  and there’s a ticking clock on every single one of them!’ Jamie and Michael looked at each other  and then back at me. ‘The girl ’ said Michael. ‘She told us more.’

“Shockingly  or maybe not  the girl had given them a lot more information during their lengthy examination. They now had her name  her honest-to-God name  and even more importantly  they knew where she lived. Over the course of the conversation  they discovered that the man who had refused to be examined was her grandfather. The woman in the bed next to her was her mother. In fact  she either lived with  or was neighbors with  every person in that room. She knew every last one of them.

“This information fired me up instantly. ‘Well  okay then!’ I said. ‘We have to go right now!’ Jamie slumped back in his chair  and Michael looked at me desperately  eyes bleary. ‘Mari  it’s 3 o’clock in the morning. We’ve been up for two days. Can we please rest  just until the sun comes up? We can’t go kicking in peoples’ doors in the middle of the night.’

“I knew he was right  but I was frustrated. I started to snap at him  and then stopped before I could say something I would regret. ‘Fine ’ I told them. ‘Don’t leave the hospital. Find a place to rest here. We’ll meet by the front doors at 8. Everyone happy?’ They nodded gratefully  and I turned to leave the room. The sound of my name stopped me in my tracks.

“‘Mariana?’ It was Chelsea. ‘We need to know what happened downstairs.’ Michael shot her a quick look and said  ‘I already told you.’ ‘I know ’ she said. ‘But now I need to hear it from her.’ I grabbed a chair  and sank slowly down into it. Turns out this night wasn’t over after all.

\------------------------------------------------------------

“The next morning  we all met  in varying states of exhaustion  in front of the large glass doors of the hospital. We hadn’t been able to wrap up our meeting until close to 4  so no one was at their best. I have no idea if they believed me completely. I have to admit  it sounds crazy  but I know what I saw  and I think the guards backed me up. At least Chelsea wasn’t looking at me with the same level of suspicion as she had the night before. 

In the last couple of hours  two of the patients in the isolation ward had died. Without any names to go on  they were photographed and immediately cremated. I had their photos  along with pictures of the other six  on my phone. Hopefully  someone at the address we were heading to could identify them. We also had two new additions to our group  local police officers. They smoked cigarettes constantly  and almost never let their hands leave their rifles. I didn’t really like them  upon first impression  but I was glad to have them there. I sure as hell couldn’t shoot anyone.

“We went out into the sprawling city  first in a police van  and then on foot when we reached the edge of a neighborhood. The way the police moved with us was more like we were being herded  rather than guarded  and more than once  they stepped on the back of my shoe or ran into me. Michael snapped something at them in Portugese  and they backed up enough so that I at least couldn’t feel their body heat on my back anymore.

“We finally got to the door and knocked. For a moment  there was no answer. Then one of the officers went around me and rapped hard on the door with the butt of his rifle. I heard movement from inside the house  coming toward the door. While we waited for the door to open  I looked around. The houses around all had signs of life: laundry hanging out to dry  open windows with music coming out  something. This house could have been abandoned based on what it looked like from the outside.

“The door finally opened  just a crack  and I could see the heavily wrinkled face of an old woman. Chelsea stepped forward  but only got out about half of one word before the officer shoved the door open and entered the house. I was appalled. You can’t just do that  right? Well  yeah  apparently you can  because the officer behind us proceeded to move forward  shoving us all into the house in front of him.

“I could now see the old woman fully  and with a swoop of horror  I saw the yellowness of her eyes and skin. She was yelling at the officers  but they ignored her  moving further into the house  kicking open doors as they went. The rest of us just stood there in shock  staring at the scene unfolding in front of us. Finally  Chelsea seemed to snap out of the trance  and went down the hall after the officers  yelling something that sounded angry.

“Michael looked at me  and gestured at the woman. ‘What do you want to ask her?’ I shook the cobwebs out of my head  and started to pull my phone out of my pocket so I could ask about the photos. Before I could get it out  I heard a scream from down the hall. We ran toward the scream. The police had kicked open a door to reveal a sick room of sorts. A dozen people in varying states of consciousness lay on the floor in the still room. But that wasn’t what had caused the scream.

“The last door in the hallway had been opened  with some force due to the padlock on the door  to reveal a boy  maybe about five years old. His skin was yellowed  his eyes were cloudy  and his hair was matted and bloody. What looked like black slime was dripping from his mouth. Even though he was tied to hooks in the floor with strong ropes  he still strained and groaned  gnashing his teeth at us.

“We stared  utterly horrified. One of the officers said something to Chelsea  and she translated  ‘He’s asking if the boy is sick or mad.’ 

“‘Sick ’ I said. ‘Everyone in this house is sick.’ Chelsea translated back to the officer. Within a second  the officer had pointed his rifle  and shot the boy between the eyes. He slumped forward  dead on the floor  a spray of gore coating the wall behind him. We all screamed and shouted  both from the shock of the sudden blast  and because of the horror that had just unfolded in front of us. The officers turned toward us  and shouted something over the noise. ‘What?’ I screamed. ‘They’re telling us to leave the house!’ yelled Michael. ‘Like hell we’re leaving!’ I shouted back.

“I guess the officers got the idea that we had no intention of moving  because now they were pointing their guns at us. That got us to shut up. They pushed us forward at the end of their guns  back down the hall and out the front door. We passed the old woman on our way out. She had now completely collapsed on the floor  crying into the moth-eaten carpet. The officers slammed the door behind us.”

She sighed heavily. “Thirteen shots over the next minute. There were no more signs of life from any of the surrounding houses. Shutters were closed  there was no more music. It looked like the street had been abandoned. Probably when they heard the first shot. We didn’t say anything to each other. What could we say? We had  for all intents and purposes  gotten these people killed. The boy was already gone  that was obvious. But maybe  if we had gotten everyone to the hospital  we could have pulled off some miracle. If I had said the boy was mad  rather than sick  would the outcome have been different?

“The officers came out of the house  pushing us in front of them all the way back to the van. The whole way back to the hospital  my mind was spinning. It seemed pretty clear that the boy was the one who had infected everyone else. He was the only child I saw in the house  and all of the bites on the comatose victims had been on lower areas of the body: ankles and hips. He was now gone  as was everyone else in his household. The ones we had in the hospital weren’t going to make it much longer. So what then?

“I thought  when we got back to the hospital  that the officers would just shove us out the door and drive off. Or maybe I hoped that. Either way  that wasn’t the case. They marched us in front of them into the lobby  where they were joined by five other officers. My heart dropped. This absolutely couldn’t be good. I tried to just walk past. We were done with them  and we had people to check on. But before I could make it a couple of feet  another officer stepped into my path. This one had a slightly different uniform… maybe a commander or something?

“‘Dr. Childress ’ he said. ‘You and your team need to come with me. You too  Dr. Rhodes.’

‘Can it wait?’ I barked. ‘I have patients to check on.’

“He smiled  maybe trying to make it a comforting smile  I’m not sure. It looked like a leer to me. ‘No  you don’t ’ he said. ‘All of your patients unfortunately passed away while you were out.’ One second was all it took for me to understand what he was saying and to become enraged.

“‘Murderer!’ I screamed. ‘You murdered people who came to a hospital to get help!’

“Within a moment  strong hands grabbed me from behind and covered my mouth. The commander or whatever waved us all behind him  and we were escorted into an office near the lobby. He informed us that  now that our business had been completed  it would be best if we left the country. He ALSO let us know that  rather unfortunately  all of our bags had been stolen  but the thieves had very helpfully left all of our passports and wallets behind. Within minutes  we were back in the police van  minus Chelsea  and heading straight to the airport. All trace of civility was long past us. This time  one of the officers rode in the back with us  hands wrapped tenderly around his gun.

“When we arrived at the airport  we were walked to our gate  had tickets shoved into our hands  and then were escorted directly to the plane before the police backed off. We flew back to the States  and then YOU all picked us up at the airport. I’ve been here ever since. I haven’t seen Michael or Jamie since we got off the plane. No idea if they’re here  or even if they’re still alive.”

I leaned forward  resting my chin on tented hands. I surveyed her thoughtfully.

“And how long  exactly  have you been here?” I asked.

“Six weeks  as far as I can tell. Don’t you know that?”

“No  Dr. Childress ” I responded. “I received your case file yesterday. I was asked by my superiors to get a full accounting of what you believe happened in Brazil.”

“It’s not what I BELIEVE happened. It's what DID happen ” she snapped.

“Of course ” I said  smiling slightly. “Do you have anything you would like to add before we end this interview?”

“One thing. Do you see the problem with what happened? The big  overarching issue here? The reason I can’t sleep at night  and you shouldn’t either?”

I raised an eyebrow at her melodramatic phrasing  but replied  “No. What is the overarching issue  Dr. Childress?”

“Come on ” she urged. “You HAVE to be able to see it. Think.”

I spread my hands indulgently. “Indulge me.”

She huffed out a sigh. She actually seemed rather disappointed in me.

“The ISSUE ” she continued  “is simple. How did the boy get sick? I mean  it’s possible that something mutated specifically in him  and he then infected others  but it’s as likely  if not moreso  that someone infected HIM. And now that our only way to trace that is dead  so is any hope of stamping this out at the root. For all we know  there could be hundreds of them. Thousands even. Shut in houses all over the country. THAT is the issue.”

I nodded. “Yes  that would be concerning. Anything else to add?”

She stared at me in disbelief. Clearly  she believed that I wasn’t taking this seriously enough. With a bewildered face  she shook her head and said  “No  I guess not.”

“Excellent. Thank you for your time.” I reached forward and switched off the tape recorder  stowing it back within my jacket pocket. I arose from the chair and aimed toward leaving the room.

“Look!” came her voice from behind me. “I know you think I’m crazy. Just some crazy woman yelling about fucking zombies in Brazil. But I know what I saw! It’s real!”

I paused  with my hand resting on the doorknob  considering whether or not to say what I was thinking. Maybe  just this once.

“Zombie is an interesting word ” I said  still facing away from her. “It’s not what WE call them.”

And I left the room  watching the door close over her stunned face.",AcceptableBee3,09-06-2020,False,False,False,False,False,4,0,0,,15,0

I hope I’ve come to the right place for some advice! 

I just recently got my first job and have come into a bigger cash flow than I’ve ever had in my life. Nothing outrageous  but more than a 50$ a week grocery and social budget. However  even though I’ve put money into savings  have bills covered  and food budget accounted for  I feel a very big amount of anxiety whenever I go to buy something. 

Before I had a job I’d talk all the time about how I’d like to decorate my home more or go out with friends to eat  but now whenever I indulge in those things I get buyers guilt and just end up not buying any of it.

In my current situation I rent a 2 bedroom apartment with my fiance. We both work  I've been at my current job over 2 years and she's been with hers for 8. Her credit is excellent  mine is not.

According to freecreditscore.com my FICO score is 612.

I have 2 open accounts with exceptional payment history  2 closed accounts (one with 3 late payments and the other listed as a charge off).

And 4 Collection Accounts ($1300  $485  $450  & $665). None of these will fall off for at least 3 more years.

I have a medical bill I'm late on that's not showing up on the reports. I don't have the total amount due but I believe it's $700.

I have a secured credit card that I pay off religiously. 

We're looking at buying a house within a year. What can I do to put us in the best possible situation to a) get approved and b) get a good deal?

Would it affect our chances positively or negatively if we got married first?

Are we better off with her buying alone since she has excellent credit?

For reference  I gross $39 000 a year and she grosses $60 000.

I owe the IRS $5 750 and am currently on a payment plan of $81 a month.

I recently came into $3 000. My initial thought was to send all of that towards the money I owe the IRS. Should I instead just pay off everything that's showing in collections and continue to just make the payments to the IRS?

/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,Low-Income Year Backdoor Roth & IRA Contribution Question,"Hi everyone! I'm about to have a low-income year and have some questions about the Backdoor Roth IRA & IRA contributions. 

In this low income year  I'm hoping to: 
(1) Do a Backdoor Roth conversion to take advantage of the low tax bracket this year (currently 100% pre-tax contributions) *and*
(2)  Contribute the max $6000 to my Roth IRA account

However  because my W2 & 1099's this year will be less than $6000  I will not be able to do (2).

The question is this - when I do (1)  would the amount I convert and get taxed on  count as earned income - therefore qualifying me to do (2)? 

Phrased another way  how do you classify the income that gets taxed during a Roth conversion? Is it earned income (since it *was* earned income during the initial contribution)? Or is it something else?

Ex) I should aim to always have $X minimum and feel free to spend the extra if I wish.

My current hours aren't too bad so I can pick up more hours no problem if I should aim to save higher. I just have no gauge for how much I can spend. Life is uncertain for college students so I want to make sure I have at least something in the bank.

I had $30 in the account all summer and i couldn't spend it since that was the minimum to keep the bank account open without having to pay a fee. Id hate for something to happen and have to go down that low ever again.

/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,Spousal IRA. Mechanics of funding me?,"Recently married and currently sorting through our financials to get our money working rather than stagnating. I am still in graduate school working on my PhD bringing in about 20K a year. My husband brings in 111K a year. My husband has inherited a fair amount such that my small income is superfluous to supporting us for the day to day expenses. I am going to focus purely on my research to finish my degree effectively and stop bringing in my small paycheck from TAing. We were able to get stretch distributions (pre secure act) and delay them this year (per care act). He has maxed out his 401K and is aiming to max out his HSA. Neither of us have opened up an IRA before. We may just slip under or perhaps be slightly over the deductible phase-out. So with that in mind...

I would greatly appreciate help with these questions

* 1) Where do the funds for a traditional IRA come from? Is it treated like your 401K with pre-tax money coming from your paycheck? Or something else... like use your post-tax money and get a deduction...
* 2) How do you set up an IRA with no income then have it funded by your spouse?
* 3) While our income is lower and we have access to these retirement savings locations  what is preferable: traditional IRA with tax deduction or roth IRA?
* 4) When we are phased out of traditional IRA deducations  certainly when I start bringing in an income (e.g.  60K)  what is preferable: roth IRA versus nondeductible traditional IRA?
* 5) When we are capped out of roth IRAs  is a nondeductible traditional IRA a reasonable thing to fund if we have already set aside our rainy day fund?

Yesterday we had a lot of protests and I messaged my neighbour who I thought was my friend saying I couldn't believe people had been protesting etc. she then messages saying that people who are known to be covid-deniers in our building are protesting out the front of the building. Low and behold I go down and see them  so I think about calling the police as I'm not getting in an argument with these people. 

What really bothered me is when I told her this she said like ""They are harmless  the police won't do anything"" and ""I don't want any drama today"" etc. as though I'm creating drama for calling the police People like them are what is causing us to be in lock down we need to have cases of 50 or less as an average over the next two weeks... and pretty much the people who protested probably have made this impossible for us as a state and I'm furious that these people think this is okay to do. 

This is the second time she has done this to me - the first time was when I went to apologise to someone who was in a shared space about the music being loud in my apartment (something she told me bothered them) and he was very rude and dismissive of me.. it made me so upset and I spoke to her on the phone about it - she told me I was so dramatic etc. and I just cause drama and if I go through my life behaving the way I do  all I do is cause drama because I was upset at how he behaved.  The neighbour did try and apologise but he came to my door without a mask as he is a covid denier so I didn't answer the door. I didn't speak to her for a little while.

/r/TwoXChromosomes/,TwoXChromosomes,Feeling useless because I couldn’t do something about sexual assault.,"Okay so  this is more like a rant I guess?

Like almost all women  I get dickpics too.
About 10 months ago I met this guy on Tinder  he was pretty nice but I broke it off before we actually had a chance to meet  because I realized I wasn’t actually ready to start dating again  I apologized and was friendly about it. He said he would’ve liked to meet me IRL but that it was okay.
Now 1 5 weeks ago  after having 0 contact for the past 10 months  he sent me a porno video clip on Snapchat (I didn’t delete him as a friend before). I told him (translated from Swiss-German) „Wtf dude  what’s wrong with you? Why would you send me that?“ and he replied „ooooomg  I‘m so sorry that wasn’t meant for you“. At that point I smelled **BULLSHIT**  because he‘d have to go back quite a while to find my profile again and send me that video. Directly after replying he sent me a DICKPIC  with the description „but it‘s a nice dick right... 😅“. To that picture I replied „Wtf dude  that’s bullshit  stop“ and he said „Why?“. WHY DO YOU THINK WHY???
Now  in Switzerland it is illegal (sexual assault) to send dickpics when the recipient has already made clear they don’t wish to receive them. And since I know his full name  where he lives (his home town  not his exact address) I thought  I could just write all this down (I took screenshots of everything he sent me) and go to the police with them. Sadly  the officers told me they couldn’t really do anything about it because it was over Snapchat (because that goes through the USA). They were really friendly about it though  like a group of 5 male officers trying to help me  even asking if I’d rather have a female officer help me. And because they couldn’t actually do anything to him  they I told me  I could text him saying „I went to the police with all the evidence and they’ve written you up. Don’t contact me anymore.“

But the thing is  I felt so useless afterwards  I felt like I could make a change somehow but I couldn’t.

I use a cup for most days of bleeding. I can feel when it needs to be changed and after getting used to it  I haven't had to clean underwear in ages.

I sleep in the NUDE. Dude. I used to sleep with a giant  uncomfortable pad AND on a towel. When I was a teen  I even had a dishtowel on top of it.
Remember those stupid commercials for pads  where they promise it won't bother you  or smell  while a grinning woman walks over a field of flowers or dances at a party? All lies. We know. But holy crap I am getting close to that  using my cup.

Of course there is downsides. It gets very graphic from here on out. Consider yourself warned.
Emptying the cup in the toilet. Some days its a lil ""plop"" and you're done. Sometimes you're sitting there  wishing that the blood could just stop pouring out of you for a second  while you jiggle the cup beneath you  trying to get that last sticky blop of goo to leave the cup. Flinging blood onto your hand and inside the bowl of the toilet.

Oh. And the period poops. Sometimes it feels like I need to remove the cup first  either bc I'm afraid that everything is getting pressed out down there  or bc it feels like it is blocking for passage. Weird. I know. Maybe its just me.

You have to get used to putting it up correctly. The first couple times I used it  I had constant leakages and it felt uncomfortable and strange.

I have uses cups for about four years now  I think. I can't imagine going back to plastic and cotton hell ever again.

Bonus: I feel better about not leaving all that trash behind each month.
Now that I think about it. Not having to take out said litteral bloody trash is really neat too.",Thedarksquirrel,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,,2,0

/r/TwoXChromosomes/,TwoXChromosomes,Obligatory sex to maintain a marriage/relationship.,I am a woman who does not enjoy sex  I never have and I’ve lost hope that I ever will  sad. I love my husband and we have two children together  but I feel like I only have sex to keep him satiated. Especially since I had my two kids and got a nexplannon birth control implant  I feel especially annoyed with the obligation to please him sexually. However  I know that a healthy sexual relationship is key to a strong marriage. What’s the balance for what is right for us? Do I deserve to be alone because I don’t like sex? I love my husbands company and our bond as a couple  I’m just not interested in sex. Is that selfish? I know he feels it and he’s not happy. It fucking sucks so bad. I find myself feeling like I need to pretend to protect myself financially and keep us together for the kids. I definitely don’t want a divorce  but with my “deficiency” in the bedroom  I wouldn’t be surprised if he started having an affair eventually  even though he’s a good man.,blahblegbleh,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,20,0,0,,2,0
/r/TwoXChromosomes/,TwoXChromosomes,I’m a toner truther.," I’m a toner truther. 

First  some background for the uninitiated. Using toner is a supposedly necessary step in any proper facial skincare routine; it goes between skin cleansing and moisturizing. The key ingredients in toners vary widely; so widely  in fact  that it makes one wonder what makes a toner a toner. As best as I can tell  based on my now 25ish years as a skincare product consumer  the only uniting feature in all the toners I’ve ever seen is that they all (or nearly all) have a very watery consistency.

My first encounter with toner was when I was 12  having a sleepover with my much cooler and more sophisticated 15 year-old godsister  Jamie. In Jamie’s latest show of adulthood  she had become the proud owner of Clinique’s 3-step skincare routine. (This was the 90s  way before the Korean 10-step routine would make landfall in the US  so cleanse-tone-moisturize was state-of-the-art for the era.) At bedtime  Jamie ceremoniously washed her face and then  with a preternatural sense of weary worldliness  pulled out a cotton ball to which she applied a watery (pink?) liquid — from a bottle helpfully labeled “2” — and proceeded to daintily swipe around her face with the moistened cotton ball. 

“What’s that?” I asked  braces glistening in the moonlight.

“Toner.”

“What does it do?”

“**It helps get your face ready for moisturizer**.”

Jamie’s tautological explanation  I would find out in the coming decades  is a common one. Unfortunately  my line of questioning always hits a dead end with my typical follow-up: “How does it do that?”

In addition to Jamie’s theory  I’ve heard several other explanations echo through the past two decades:

-	It balances the pH of your skin! Okay  but why not just use a facial cleanser that doesn’t fuck up your skin’s pH in the first place? Or make it standard for moisturizers to have ingredients that restore the skin’s pH. (If that’s even a valid thing.)
-	It exfoliates! Some toners have chemical exfoliants (exfoliators?) in them  sure. Glycolic acid  for example  it pretty common. But there are many super common toners  like witch hazel-based ones  that do not have any apparent exfoliation properties. I could buy the idea that exfoliating toners are a completely reasonable subset of toners; but wtf is a toner to begin with? Like what is the toner’s *main* function? 
-	It gets any dirt or makeup left behind after cleaning! It’s normal for small amounts of makeup to be left behind after a quick face cleanse. By why would that problem — if it is  in fact  a problem — need a whole new product? Why not just wash your face twice (which now seems to be the new conventional wisdom anyway)? This explanation is even less satisfying than the pH explanation. It may be somewhat unfair to ask a facial cleanser to shoulder the burden of optimizing pH  but is cleansing really too much to ask of a facial cleanser? Do I really need a different product to shame my incompetent cleanser each day?

So  please  change my view. Convince me that toner deserves a moment of my time each day. Not a specific toner  mind you  but the idea of needing toner in general.

Or tell me I’m right. I’ve been waiting so long for someone to be like: “Yes  girl  yes. It’s all a marketing scam.”",pseudonymREDACTED,09-07-2020,False,1599379865.0,False,False,False,6,0,0,,6,0
