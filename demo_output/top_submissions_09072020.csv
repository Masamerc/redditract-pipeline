/r/announcements/,announcements,The FCC’s vote was predictably frustrating  but we’re not done fighting for net neutrality.,"Following today’s disappointing vote from the FCC  Alexis and I wanted to take the time to thank redditors for your incredible activism on this issue  and reassure you that we’re going to continue fighting for the free and open internet. 

Over the past few months  we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \(twice\)  read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users’ everyday lives  see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \(with over 100 000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\)  and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.

It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.d11780a12cc2)  not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality)  [the FCC’s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968)  [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf)  [dozens of senators  and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). 

Nevertheless  today’s vote is the beginning  not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped  this is far from over.

Many of you have asked what comes next. We don’t exactly know yet  but it seems likely that the FCC’s decision will be challenged in court soon  and we would be supportive of that challenge. It’s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong  enforceable net neutrality rules that aren’t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless  this will be a complex process that takes time.

What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. 

This isn’t the outcome we wanted  but you should all be proud of the awareness you’ve created. Those who thought that they’d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two  and we still may come out on top of this yet. We’ll keep you informed as things develop.

/r/announcements/,announcements,Upvote the Downvote: Tell Congress to use the CRA to save net neutrality!,"Hey  Reddit! 

It’s been a couple months since the FCC voted to repeal federal net neutrality regulations. We were all disappointed in the decision  but we told you we’d continue the fight  and we wanted to share an update on what you can do to help. 

The debate has now moved to Congress  which is good news. Unlike the FCC  which is unelected and less immediately accountable to voters  members of Congress depend on input from their constituents to help inform their positions—especially during an election year like this one. 

“But wait ” you say. “I already called my Congressperson last year  and we’re still in this mess! What’s different now?” Three words: **Congressional Review Act.**

# What is it?

The Congressional Review Act \(CRA\) is basically Congress’s downvote. It lets them undo the FCC’s order through a “resolution of disapproval.” This can be formally introduced in both the Senate and the House within 60 legislative days after the FCC’s order is officially published in the Federal Register  which happened last week. It needs a simple majority in both houses to pass. Our friends at Public Knowledge have made [a video explaining the process](https://youtu.be/VABCjxFtRnI).

# What’s happening in Congress?

Now that the FCC order has been published in the Federal Register  the clock for the CRA is ticking. Members of both the House and Senate who care about Net Neutrality have already been securing the votes they need to pass the resolution of disapproval. In fact  the Senate version is only [**#onemorevote**](https://www.battleforthenet.com/onemorevote/) away from the 51 it needs to pass! 

# What should I do?

Today  we’re calling on you to phone your members of Congress and tell them what you think! You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on [this scoreboard](https://www.battleforthenet.com/scoreboard/). If they’re already on board with the CRA  great! Thank them for their efforts and tell them you appreciate it. Positive feedback for good work is important.

If they still need convincing  here is a script to help guide your conversation:

“My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I live in \_\_\_\_\_\_. I’m calling today to share my support for strong net neutrality rules. I’d like to ask Senator/Representative\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to use the CRA to pass a resolution of disapproval overturning the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality.”

# Pro tips:

\-**Be polite**. That thing your grandma said about the flies and the honey and the vinegar is right. Remember  the people who disagree with us are the ones we need to convince. 

\-**Only call the Senators and Representatives who actually represent YOU**. Calls are most effective when they come from actual constituents. If you’re not sure who represents you or how to get in touch with them  you can look it up [here](https://www.publicknowledge.org/act-now/tell-congress-to-use-the-cra-to-save-net-neutrality/#anchor).

\-**If this issue affects you personally because of who you are or what you do  let them know!** Local business owner who uses the web to reach customers? Caregiver who uses telemedicine to consult patients? Parent whose child needs the internet for school assignments? Share that. The more we can put a human face on this  the better.

\-**Don’t give up.** The nature of our democratic system means that things can be roundabout  messy  and take a long time to accomplish. Perseverance is key. We’ll be with you every step of the way.",arabscarab,02-27-2018,False,False,False,False,False,4766,49,51,,161935,0
/r/announcements/,announcements,An old team at reddit,"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman  founder and the original reddit CEO  is returning as CEO.
 
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos  recruited a world-class team of executives  and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions  and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
 
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit  and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully  community is harder)  which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis  who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
 
A few other points.  Mods  you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team  now with Steve  wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
 
Second  redditors  you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.

Third  as a redditor  I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
 
As a closing note  it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.

If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion  it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
 
 
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not  are not covered under free speech  and will continue to get offending users banned.

Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this  and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices  unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
 
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight  it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.


NOTE: I am going to let the reddit team answer questions here  and go do an AMA myself now.

Hey Reddit  time for another update in the Net Neutrality fight!

When we [last checked in](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/80jsi9/upvote_the_downvote_tell_congress_to_use_the_cra/) on this in February  we told you about the [Congressional Review Act](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17314404/net-neutrality-cra-congressional-review-act-markey-senate)  which allows Congress to undo the FCC’s repeal of Net Neutrality. That process took a big step forward today as the CRA petition was discharged in the Senate. That means a full Senate vote is likely soon  so let’s remind them that we’re watching!

[Today  you’ll see sites across the web go on “RED ALERT”](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/05/03/red-alert-net-neutrality-gains-steam-internet-heavyweights-back-campaign) in honor of this cause. Because this is Reddit  we thought that [Orangered](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=orangered) Alert was more fitting  but the call to action is the same. Join users across the web in [calling your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) \(both of ‘em!\) to let them know that you support using the Congressional Review Act to save Net Neutrality. You can learn more about the effort [here](https://netneutrality.internetassociation.org/action/).

We’re also delighted to share that Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts  the lead sponsor of the CRA petition  will be joining us for an AMA in r/politics today at 2:30 pm ET  hot off the Senate floor  so get your questions ready!

Finally  seeing [the creative ways the Reddit community gets involved](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) in this issue is always the best part of these actions. Maybe you’re the mod of a community that has organized something in honor of the day. Or you want to share something really cool that your Senator’s office told you when you called them up. Or maybe you’ve made the dankest of net neutrality\-themed memes. Let us know in the comments!

There is strength in numbers  and we’ve pulled off the impossible before through simple actions just like this. So let’s give those Senators a big  Reddit\-y hug.

/r/announcements/,announcements,We had a security incident. Here's what you need to know.,"**TL;DR**: A hacker broke into a few of Reddit’s systems and managed to access some user data  including some current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords. Since then we’ve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed  and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again. 

**What happened?**

On June 19  we learned that between June 14 and June 18  an attacker compromised a few of our employees’ accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA)  we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope  and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA. 

Although this was a serious attack  the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data  source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information  and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys  and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.

Now that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact  we want to share what we know  how it may impact you  and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.

**What information was involved?**

Since June 19  we’ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:

* **All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses**
   * *What was accessed:* A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site’s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit’s first years it had many fewer features  so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted *hashed* passwords)  email addresses  and all content (mostly public  but also private messages) from way back then.
   * *How to tell if your information was included:* We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007  you’re clear here. Check your PMs and/or email inbox: we will be notifying you soon if you’ve been affected.
* **Email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018**
   * *What was accessed:* Logs containing the email digests we sent between June 3 and June 17  2018. The logs contain the digest emails themselves -- they [look like this](https://i.redd.it/dtdpfncm6dd11.png). The digests connect a username to the associated email address and contain suggested posts from select popular and safe-for-work subreddits you subscribe to. 
   * *How to tell if your information was included:* If you don’t have an email address associated with your account or your “email digests” user preference was unchecked during that period  you’re not affected. Otherwise  search your email inbox for emails from [noreply@redditmail.com](mailto:noreply@redditmail.com) between June 3-17  2018. 

As the attacker had read access to our storage systems  other data was accessed such as Reddit source code  internal logs  configuration files and other employee workspace files  but these two areas are the most significant categories of user data.

**What is Reddit doing about it?**

Some highlights. We:

* Reported the issue to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.
* Are messaging user accounts if there’s a chance the credentials taken reflect the account’s current password. 
* Took measures to guarantee that additional points of privileged access to Reddit’s systems are more secure (e.g.  enhanced logging  more encryption and requiring token-based 2FA to gain entry since we suspect weaknesses inherent to SMS-based 2FA to be the root cause of this incident.)

**What can you do?**

First  check whether your data was included in either of the categories called out above by following the instructions there.

If your account credentials were affected and there’s a chance the credentials relate to the password you’re currently using on Reddit  we’ll make you reset your Reddit account password. Whether or not Reddit prompts you to change your password  think about whether you still use the password you used on Reddit 11 years ago on any other sites today. 

If your email address was affected  think about whether there’s anything on your Reddit account that you wouldn’t want associated back to that address. You can find instructions on how to remove information from your account on this [help page](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/removing-your-reddit-data).

And  as in all things  a strong unique password and [enabling 2FA](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication) (which we only provide via an authenticator app  not SMS) is recommended for all users  and be alert for potential phishing or scams.",KeyserSosa,08-02-2018,False,False,False,False,False,7636,73,76,,73273,0
/r/announcements/,announcements,Introducing Reddit Polls  An All-New Post Type,"If you’re looking for an opinion on anything — the most underrated TV show of the nineties; the very best drugstore mascara; the most athletic NFL player of all-time — there’s no better place to get honest answers and gauge consensus  than on Reddit.

Today  in an effort to elevate Reddit’s diverse opinion-based content  we’re excited to introduce Polls: a brand new post type that encourages redditors to share their opinion via voting. We’ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months  and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited to now release this post type to everyone!

**Why Polls?**

It can sometimes be tough for new redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit    and to feel a sense of community. We believe a simple post type that reduces the posting barrier will make it easier than ever for everyone to contribute to their favorite communities and engage in different ways.

Here’s a look at some of our recent test polls

**Platform Support**

* iOS: Supports poll creation and voting
* Android: Supports poll creation and voting **(EDIT: there is a bug on old versions of Android that cause the app to crash for some redditors when they vote. Updating the app to the new version will fix it.)**
* New Reddit (web): Supports poll creation and voting
* Old Reddit (web): Does not support creation. At the bottom of a poll  redditors will see a link to view the poll. Clicking the link will open a new tab where they can view results and vote in the poll
* Mobile web: Supports voting. No plans for poll creation support

/r/announcements/,announcements,Scores on posts are about to start going up,"In the 11 years that Reddit has been around  we've accumulated [a lot of rules](https://i.redd.it/oek2mm1io01y.png) in our vote tallying as a way to mitigate cheating and brigading on posts and comments.   [Here's a rough schematic of what the code looks like without revealing any trade secrets or compromising the integrity of the algorithm.](https://i.redd.it/dastklohq01y.gif)  Many of these rules are still quite useful  but there are a few whose primary impact has been [to sometimes artificially deflate scores on the site](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/z1sfn/one_minute_obamas_ama_karma_score_was_16000_a/).  


Unfortunately  determining the impact of all of these rules is difficult without doing a drastic recompute of all the vote scores historically… so we did that!  Over the past few months  we have carefully recomputed historical votes on posts and comments to remove outdated  unnecessary rules. 


Very soon (think hours  not days)  we’re going to cut the scores over to be reflective of these new and updated tallies.  A side effect of this is many of our seldom-recomputed listings (e.g.  pretty much anything ending in /top) are going to initially display improper sorts. Please don’t panic. Those listings are computed via regular (scheduled) jobs  and as a result those pages will gradually come to reflect the new scoring over the course of the next four to six days.  We expect there to be some shifting of the top/all time queues.  New items will be added in the proper place in the listing  and old items will get reshuffled as the recomputes come in.  


To support the larger numbers that will result from this change  we’ll be updating the score display to switch to “k” when the score is over 10 000. Hopefully  this will not require you to further edit your subreddit CSS.   


**TL;DR** voting is confusing  we cleaned up some outdated rules on voting  and we’re updating the vote scores to be reflective of what they actually are. Scores are increasing by a lot. 

**Edit**: The scores just updated.  Everyone should now see ""k""s.  Remember: it's going to take about a week for top listings to recompute to reflect the change.

Played the beta of Star Wars battlefront 2 and you still can't just get in a vehicle  it feels so fake. Why is Rey in the clone wars!? That is all bad  but EA have just totally taken the piss with abusing Star Wars fans and cutting their games into little pieces and bleeding the fan base dry. 

I've had enough.

Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received  it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues  rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes  progression grind  the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.  

Edit 3: Thank you kind strangers for the reddit gold!

/r/Music/,Music,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules  allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps  slow websites  and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged  so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7  one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees  engaging in censorship  or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites  apps  and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC  Ajit Pai  is a former top lawyer for Verizon  and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores  we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC  so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators  and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon  not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not  you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/)  and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick  fun  and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th  you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress  or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",JPTIII,11-22-2017,False,False,False,False,False,1731,4,10,,146519,0

/r/Music/,Music,The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge us extra fees to access sites  apps  games  and especially the music we all love.,"Hey everyone  **the chairman of the FCC  is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality  possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.** Once a vote is called  it will become much  much harder to stop ISPs from charging us all extra fees to access streaming services or watch music videos -- and they can demand payment from independent artists and labels  stifling independent voices

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives  now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down  but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also  if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality  its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please  head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com   and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone  **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office  introduce yourself  be polite  and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically  I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

/r/science/,science,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate  much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities  a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students  who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs  where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students  even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD  /u/keysersosa  the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard  and make sacrifices  a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/)  which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself  I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7 000  and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead  some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia  most of these students will never return to the USA. 


This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy)  make no mistake  this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).

In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).


What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet  but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now  we will all regret it.

We are now living under the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. We have got to end one-party rule in Washington and elect progressive governors and state officials.

/r/askscience/,askscience,Black Lives Matter,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long  and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1 000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police  police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019  1 099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black  even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths  healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan  black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana  black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs  with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities  these crises  are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism  economic inequality  and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward  too. For over a decade  AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time  and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible  and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However  we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US  black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce  but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce  6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher  and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+  their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example  as of 2019  less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color  and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful  both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented  brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism  sexism  and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence  racism  and economic  social  and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard  to listen  and to offer support. We must be the change.

This post is motivated by the events of today coupled with previous interactions AskScience moderators have had in the past with the reddit staff.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an issue that has been chronically inadequate for moderators of large subreddits reaching out to the admins over the years. Reddit is a great site with an even more amazing community  however it is frustrating to volunteer time to run a large subreddit and have questions go unacknowledged by the people running the site.

ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives  now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down  but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also  if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality  its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please  head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com   and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone  **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office  introduce yourself  be polite  and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically  I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

/r/LifeProTips/,LifeProTips,LPT: keep your mouth shut  and don't volunteer information,"I had a phone interview scheduled this morning  but accidentally slept through it. When I got up and saw that I missed it  I had the desperate urge to call and offer up excuses  in the hope that maybe  just maybe  they'd be understanding and give me another chance. 

Instead  all I did was apologize and ask if we could reschedule. That's it  one sentence  no additional information  no explanation or excuse as to why I missed the first interview. 

They replied within 20 minutes  apologizing to ME  saying it was probably their fault  that they'd been having trouble with their computer system for days  and of course I could reschedule  was I available that afternoon?

Don't ever volunteer information  kids. You never know what information the other party has  and you can always give information if asked for it later.

/r/blog/,blog,We need your voice as we continue the fight for net neutrality,"My fellow [redditors](https://www.reddit.com/mobile/download)  

When Steve and I created this site twelve years ago  our vision was simple but powerful. We wanted to create an open platform for communities and their members to find and discuss the content they found most interesting. And today  that principle is exactly what net neutrality is all about: preserving an open internet with consumer choice and unimpeded access to information.

Net neutrality ensures that the free market—not big cable—picks the winners and losers. This is a [bipartisan issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/6c2mzt/antinet_neutrality_is_everyones_problem/)  and we at Reddit will continue to fight for it. We’ve been here [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2sjkf0/join_us_in_a_final_push_for_net_neutrality_its_as/)  and this time we’re facing even worse odds.

But as we all know  you should never tell redditors the odds.

### A level playing field

Net neutrality gives new ideas  online businesses  and up-and-coming sites—like Reddit was twelve years ago—the opportunity to find an audience and grow on a level playing field. Saving net neutrality is crucial for the future of entrepreneurship in the digital age.

We weren’t always in the [top ten most-viewed sites in the U.S.](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US) When Steve and I started Reddit right out of college  we were just two kids with $12K in funding and some computers in Medford  MA. Our plan was to make something people wanted  because we knew if we accomplished that  we could win—even against massive incumbents. 

But we wouldn’t have succeeded if users had to pay extra to visit our website  or if better-funded alternatives loaded faster. Our start-up got to live the American dream thanks to the open internet  and I want to be able to tell aspiring entrepreneurs with a straight face that they can build the next Reddit. If we lose net neutrality  I can’t tell them that.

### We did it  Reddit  and we can do it again.

You all are capable of creating movements.

I’ve had a front-row seat to witness the power of Reddit communities to rally behind a common goal—starting when you all named a whale [Mister Splashy Pants](https://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_a_splash_in_social_media) in 2007. It’s been heartening to watch your collective creativity and energy over the years; it’s easy to take all these amazing moments of community and conversation for granted  but the thing that makes them all possible is the open internet  which unites redditors as an issue above all.

Here’s a quick recap:

* In 2012  [we coordinated with mods to black out the website to protest SOPA & PIPA](https://redditblog.com/2012/01/10/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all-depends/). They called these two bills “inevitable” in DC until America spoke up and they became “unthinkable.”
* Then  [you all crowdfunded a bus we took through the heartland to support the open internet](http://www.adweek.com/digital/inside-reddits-internet-2012-bus-144244/). 
* Back in 2014  [you all rallied to deluge the FCC with thoughtful comments in support of net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/275mqp/reddit_there_are_only_45000_comments_on_the_fccs/)  and [we collected your best comments for our own letter to the FCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2aohmu/reddit_is_filing_an_fcc_comment_to_fight_for_an/). 
* [You crowdfunded $20 000 to put up net neutrality ads across DC](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/13/5711012/net-neutrality-protest-posters-go-up-across-washington-ahead-of-fcc-vote).
* In the span of a few hours  [you made over 15 000 phone calls to the FCC and your representatives](https://redditblog.com/2015/01/15/join-us-in-a-final-push-for-net-neutrality-its-as-easy-as-calling-858-wheeler/)!

And all of this actually *worked*.

It’s not just about the U.S.  because [redditors in India have used the site to defend net neutrality](https://redditblog.com/podcast/a-neutral-net-part-two/) and the CRTC (the Canadian equivalent of the FCC) [visited r/Canada for a thoughtful (and 99% upvoted!) discussion with citizens](https://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/54kz6g/im_from_the_crtc_and_we_want_to_know_what_you/). 

Reddit is simply too large to ignore  and you all did all of this when we were just a fraction of the size we are today.

### Time to get back to work

We’re proud to join major internet companies like Amazon  Etsy  Twitter  and Netflix ([better late than never!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/06/15/netflix-joining-next-months-net-neutrality-protest-says-it-will-never-outgrow-the-fight/)) in today’s Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality  orchestrated by Fight for the Future. We’ve already been hosting AMAs on the subject with politicians (like [Senator Schatz](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6k27ny/im_us_senator_brian_schatz_lead_democrat_on_the/)) and journalists (like [Brian Fung from the Washington Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6lfkwh/im_brian_fung_a_washington_post_reporter_covering/)). Today we’re changing our logo and sharing a special message from Steve  our CEO  with every visitor to our front page to raise awareness and send people to **[BattleForTheNet.com](http://battleforthenet.com)**. Most exciting  [dozens of communities on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) (with millions of subscribers) across party lines and interest areas have joined the cause. If your community hasn’t joined in yet  now’s the time! (And you’ll be in good company: u/Here_Comes_The_King is on our side.)

*The FCC [is deciding this issue the way big cable and ISPs want it to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/18/fcc-votes-to-start-rolling-back-landmark-net-neutrality-rules/?utm_term=.b7242cbf9cd1)  so it’s on us as citizens to tell them—and our representatives in the Senate and House—how important the open internet is to our economy  our society  and especially for when we’re bored at work.*

I invite everyone who cares about this across the internet to come talk about it with us on Reddit. Join the conversation  upvote stories about net neutrality’s importance to keep them top of mind  [make a high-quality GIF or two](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/6gnyl4/giffing_for_net_neutrality/)  and  most importantly  [contact the FCC](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) to let them know why *you* care about protecting the open internet.

This is how we win: when every elected official realizes how vital net neutrality is to all of their constituents.

/r/blog/,blog,An Open Letter to the Reddit Community,"After two weeks abroad  I was looking forward to returning to the U.S. this weekend  but as I got off the plane at LAX on Sunday  I wasn't sure what country I was coming back to.

President Trump’s recent executive order is not only potentially unconstitutional  but deeply un-American. We are a nation of immigrants  after all. In the tech world  we often talk about a startup’s “unfair advantage” that allows it to beat competitors. Welcoming immigrants and refugees has been our country's unfair advantage  and coming from an immigrant family has been mine as an entrepreneur.

As many of you know  I am the son of an undocumented immigrant from Germany and the great grandson of refugees who fled the Armenian Genocide.

A little over a century ago  a Turkish soldier decided my great grandfather was too young to kill after cutting down his parents in front of him; instead of turning the sword on the boy  the soldier sent him to an orphanage. Many Armenians  including my great grandmother  found sanctuary in Aleppo  Syria—before the two reconnected and found their way to Ellis Island. Thankfully they weren't retained  rather they found this message:

*“Give me your tired  your poor  your huddled masses yearning to breathe free  the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these  the homeless  tempest-tossed to me  I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”*

My great grandfather didn’t speak much English  but he worked hard  and was able to get a job at Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in Binghamton  NY. That was his family's golden door. And though he and my great grandmother had four children  all born in the U.S.  immigration continued to reshape their family  generation after generation. The one son they had—my grandfather [(here’s his AMA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29039l/iam_john_ohanian_92_year_old_lawyer_parttime/)—volunteered to serve in the Second World War and married a French-Armenian immigrant. And my mother  a native of Hamburg  Germany  decided to leave her friends  family  and education behind after falling in love with my father  who was born in San Francisco.

She got a student visa  came to the U.S. and then worked as an au pair  uprooting her entire life for love in a foreign land. She overstayed her visa. She should have left  but she didn't. After she and my father married  she received a green card  which she kept for over a decade until she became a citizen. I grew up speaking German  but she insisted I focus on my English in order to be successful. She eventually got her citizenship and I’ll never forget her swearing in ceremony.

If you’ve never seen people taking the pledge of allegiance for the first time as U.S. Citizens  it will move you: a room full of people who can really appreciate what I was lucky enough to grow up with  simply by being born in Brooklyn. It thrills me to write reference letters for enterprising founders who are looking to get visas to start their companies here  to create value and jobs for these United States.

My forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I’ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land  that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here. 

Without them  there’s no me  and there’s no Reddit. We are Americans. Let’s not forget that we’ve thrived as a nation because we’ve been a beacon for the courageous—the tired  the poor  the tempest-tossed.

Right now  Lady Liberty’s lamp is dimming  which is why it's more important than ever that we speak out and show up to support all those for whom it shines—past  present  and future. I ask you to do this however you see fit  whether it's calling your representative (this works  it's how we defeated SOPA + PIPA)  marching in protest  [donating to the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu)  or voting  of course  and not just for Presidential elections.

Our platform  like our country  thrives the more people and communities we have within it. Reddit  Inc. will continue to welcome all citizens of the world to our digital community and our office.

Hi All 

If you spent any time on Reddit last week  you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page  so we wanted to take a moment to recap what’s happened so far in the fight for net neutrality  underscore how important this issue is to Reddit  and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.

On Tuesday  FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays  you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country  you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site  from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. You’ve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/)  flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/)  explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/)  and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. 

In just one week  you made 50 000 unique posts and over 350 000 comments related to net neutrality  generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday’s news hits close to home  we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.

As many of you know  the FCC’s vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However  the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court  likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time  Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality’s giving us a fair chance in the marketplace  we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans don’t see this as a partisan issue  and neither do we.

Most of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don’t introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally  they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC’s decision  we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcel’s suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to “make a ruckus” to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  

A few months ago  u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/)  and thousands of you delivered. Today  we’re asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July  we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. 

We will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress  with the media  and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be  so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices  from Capitol Hill to — if it comes to it — the Supreme Court. 

So  please tell us in the comments:

*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic  or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* 

Include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally  the more specific  the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.

Thank you.

/r/listentothis/,listentothis,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules  allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps  slow websites  and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged  so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7  one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees  engaging in censorship  or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites  apps  and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC  Ajit Pai  is a former top lawyer for Verizon  and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores  we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC  so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators  and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon  not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**
[Click here](https://events.battleforthenet.com/#eventType=protestrally) and you’ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not  you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/)  and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick  fun  and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th  you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress  or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.",JPTIII,11-22-2017,False,False,False,False,False,1836,3,1,,139156,0
/r/listentothis/,listentothis,The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge us extra fees to access sites  apps  games  and especially the music we all love. [discussion],"Hey everyone  **the chairman of the FCC is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality  possibly as soon as this week.** Once a vote is called  it will become much  much harder to stop ISPs from charging us all extra fees to access streaming services like YouTube -- and they can demand payment from independent artists and labels  stifling independent voices...

[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives  now through Nov. 22nd.](https://www.battleforthenet.com)

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down  but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also  if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality  its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please  head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com   and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.
To reach the call in line directly by phone  **call 202-930-8550.**
When you get through to your Rep's office  introduce yourself  be polite  and say:

>I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically  I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

/r/listentothis/,listentothis,[discussion] 11 million subscribers and /r/listentothis is dead. Maybe it's time for a format change?,"Maybe we just need to revise the rules. Allow folks to post music by established artists or side projects of established artists. Even when a video has a bunch of views  there are still folks who have never heard of it. This sub could be for discovery of music new to the listener  but it's forcing discovery of new artists. How is a sub with 11million subscribers so dead? 

Edit: Rip my inbox. 

Edit 2: I didn't mean for this to be a drama post  or a ""bitching at the mods"" post. My intention was to call attention to how restrictive the posting rules have gotten. Too much exposure  can't post  too little exposure  can't post. I like the idea of an artist lockout period to prevent saturation. I also agree that posts shouldn't be down voted for disliking a genre. The rules regarding votes seems pretty reasonable  upvote if an artist is new to you  don't vote if you've heard them before. Ultimately  I don't really know what to change to make it more welcoming and enjoyable. I've enjoyed much of what I've heard here  it's been a great last year in this sub. I don't want to see it fall into sub limbo due to over moderation. One Love. ",-Dubwise-,06-19-2017,False,1497837070.0,False,False,False,1764,0,0,,26108,0

/r/listentothis/,listentothis,[Discussion] ACTION to SAVE NET NEUTRALITY and the WORLD's LARGEST MUSIC LIBRARY!,"EDIT: This is very long. So  no  you don't have to read the whole thing if you are not part of our movement  #mala.

This is reference tool for you to use when fighting to save net neutrality.

**MAIN PROBLEM**

Not enough people are making enough noise about net neutrality.

**WTF? WHY?**
 
People can't get motivated about net neutrality if they don't know what to do.

**MAIN PROBLEMS with NET NEUTRALITY**
* **Intro:** These are the problems that I have noticed with the net neutrality movement.
 
* **Disorganized**: There are several different voices shouting everywhere at once. People are confused on what to do.

* **Contradicting Messages**: There are contradicting messages about net neutrality. Believe or not  there are people who don't understand what net neutrality is **who are against it.** There's too much misinformation about this (*should be*) simple subject.

* **Confusion:** The contradicting messages about net neutrality have people confused. People don't want to feel confused.

* **Naivety/Blind Hope:** People don't want to feel hopeless about life. Net neutrality seems to be one of those subjects that seem way too complicated. They are trying to feel as happy as they can - if they know it's pointless because it's **an emotional defense mechanism.**


* **Circlejerking:** Most net neutrality supporters tend to spend most of their time where other net neutrality supporters are. They're not reaching out to people who desperately need to hear their message.


* **Low Morale:** Most net neutrality supporters (and the Internet citizenry as a whole) feel defeated. They don't know about Senators who support net neutrality or the those who have went from being neutral to being in support.


* **Perception:** The only people I have heard talking about net neutrality are Millennial kids. Older Americans (if they disliked Trump). Net neutrality is seen too much as a liberal thing  **and not a free speech** thing.


* **Infiltrated/Corrupted YouTubers:** Some YouTubers and Internet celebrities (such as Ezra Klein and Casey Neistat) have been corrupted with their media presence being sold to media companies owned by the ISP's. Their call-to-action is to call the FCC  **an agency currently known for dodging  ignoring  and even lying**  and instead of using leverage in order to pressure the FCC to stop. They are misleading that potential energy into a wasted effort.


* **Tech Companies Not Pushing Hard Enough:** Facebook  Google  and Netflix are not pushing hard enough for net neutrality like they used to. The people on their social media platforms (especially Instagram) are pushing net neutrality on a minute-by-minute basis but the company isn't taking a stance on the issue.


* **Little Coverage from 'Clean' YouTubers:** YouTubers  the ones who drive (and make a living from) controversy are not talking about net neutrality. 

**ASSETS that WE DO HAVE**

*We've discussed the problems. Let's discussed the tools that we do have on our side. Yes  we have the greatest human invention and that comes with some assets. :)*
 
* **Online businesses:** Online business  by design  has a direct incentive  in having the least amount of overhead and the most amount of customer reach. No net neutrality means that customer reach is **severely limited**. Mention this to online businesses in getting their support in letting their audience know about net neutrality.
 
* **Instagram**: There are businesses on Instagram that want net neutrality to stay. You can send these businesses a message about net neutrality.

**Basic Human Psychology**: **The most important thing that you must know: Humans use emotions FIRST and justify with logic SECOND. GO for the EMOTIONAL first.** Net neutrality is already straightforward. 
	
* **Use anger/fear to motivate**: If people are comfortable  they don't move. Use anger to get people uncomfortable. You can spark anger by presenting Ajit Pai as the enemy and the Internet as the child. *Motivate people with anger to protect the Internet as the child that is danger.* 


* **Use humor to create relaxation**: Net neutrality is a stressful. Use humor to get people interested in net neutrality by making it funny. People need to laugh. Too much negative emotion can repel people.


* **Use short messages (less than 6 words in a slogan)**: Use short messages that are easy to remember and unable to counteract against. A great example: **""Net neutrality is ONLINE FREE SPEECH.""**


* **Avoid depression phase**: People get depressed because they feel fucked over and they feel that they have no options. Don't let your viewer or your audience hit that depression phase. You have to immediately show the call-to-action/[Battle for the Net](https://battleforthenet.com)

**Vast Array of Talents:** The Internet is a vast place. We all have some sort of talent.
 
* **Art:** You can draw a webcomic and share it like crazy on social media platforms. Seriously  share it. Share it everywhere: Tumblr  Facebook  Twitter  Instagram.


* **Infographics**: Any business professionals out here? I need you to make some Infographics and showcase how the net neutrality repeal can harm their business marketing efforts.


* **Memes:** You can't draw? Make memes. Make a lot of memes. Spread those memes everywhere on Facebook  Twitter  YouTube (to get some robot YouTuber to read it).


* **Music:** Make a song about net neutrality and upload it to Soundcloud. Share it everywhere on Facebook  Instagram  YouTube  Twitter  to your favorite content creators that they can use.


* **Humor:** Do people laugh with or at you? Who cares  either way. Get them laughing about net neutrality and motivate them to **call their Senator and their Representative.**


* **Comedy:** Use comedy skits to your advantage to convince people in order to get them to understand the FFC vote. Make sure that your call-to-action is getting people to call their Senators and their Representative.


* **Lowbrow:** Use the lowbrow humor. An example: ""I wanted to fap to Pornhub but I need a porn package from AT&T. (**DON'T LET AT&T TELL WHO YOU CAN FAP TO. CALL YOUR SENATOR and YOUR REP TODAY!**)


* **Stir Up Controversy:** For people who did extensive research on this subject only  find a Libertarian/anti-net neutrality opponent with an audience and challenge them to a **public** debate about net neutrality.


* **Storytelling:** Are you great with writing stories. Write a story  team up with an artist or an animator so that people can visually understand that what you are telling them.


* **Sex Appeal:** Are you sexy as hell? Are you a BBW cam model? Well  use your sexy body to get people interested in saving net neutrality. Give a free cam show to those who called their Senators and their Representative. Yes  **SEX APPEAL** is an **ASS**et.

**Everyone Has A Direct Interest in Preserving The Internet:** The greatest human invention where we can see Mars at any time and even allows us to fap whenever we want. Everyone in the USA has a stake in keeping the Internet open and free.
 
* **Everyone Hates Their ISP**: Comcast is famous for this. They charge people **AFTER** they cancel their service. Use this as an opportunity to convince to take revenge against their ISP's by calling their Senator and their Representative to enact them to do something.


* **People Against Net Neutrality**: These people also want the same thing as you. It's worse to see that but it's true. They are just misinformed. For these people  use well-citied evidence that they can't refute. Also  use Pai's lies to fuel your explanation. (**Yes  Pai is on your side...I will explain later.**)

**Ajit Pai:** This gorgeous bastard is going to help us save the Internet. That's right  he's an asset. Tired of fighting an uphill battle: **We can leverage Ajit Pai against himself. ** 
 
* **He's An Enemy:** He's Public Enemy #1 of the Internet - and he deserves it  too. So  how do we make him work for us.

* **He's Smug:** We can use his smugness against him. We can show that Mean Tweets video of him to direct them to going to [BattlefortheNet.com.](https://battleforthenet.com)



* **He's Got That Mean Tweets Video:** If I was ever running against him in an election  this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBt84HNAGwU) would be a godsend. We can use that video  put simple messages on it  and share it like crazy on Facebook. **The most important part would be that we convert people into calling their Senators and their Representatives via https://battleforthenet.co. Spread this video around while memeing it up saying  ""THIS GUY WANTS TO CHARGE YOU FOR EVERY SITE YOU GO TO"". ""DON'T LET HIM! CALL YOUR SENATOR and YOUR REP"". [This video  believe it or not  is a godsend! We can use this video against Ajit Pai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBt84HNAGwU) **so spread this video around Facebook relentlessly while captions to direct people to [Battle for the Net](https://battleforthenet.com).


* **We Can Bring Down His Plan with His Own Undoing:** Ajit is literally giving us the ammunition that we need to strike his plan. We can make **fun  easy-to-read Infographics** to compare his plan to how reality works.


* **ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: AJIT WANTS US TO HATE HIM. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE DIRECT THAT ANGER AT HIM INTO STRIKING HIM WHERE IT HURTS: HIS PROPOSAL. DIRECT THE ANGER INTO CALLING SENATORS and REPRESENTATIVES on BATTLEFORTHENET.com.**


* **Holy shit  his constant lying record**: He is constantly lying. Regardless of the FCC vote  our Senators and Representatives are going to need a constant record of his lies and the truths that are opposed to his plan. Send your Senators and Representatives. Also  use Infographics to publish on Linkedin so that people can see the Infographics and fully understand why Pai is lying his ass off.


* **His past**: **He's a ex-Verizon lawyer working in an agency that is supposed to police **Verizon**. A great explanation for why this is wrong would be: **""A crackhead in charge of the DEA""**; **""Micheal Vick running PETA""**; **""A pedophile running an elementary school.""**


* **Avoid Using Trump as The Enemy:** Bear in mind that half of the country voted for Trump. 

**These are the people that we have to reach.** We don't need Trump to be the enemy; Ajit Pai is just fine **and ten times better** as our enemy and he has all the smugness  treacherous history  lies  and hate against him to get people upset and ready to move.


**Social Media**: We have social media and private messaging apps. We can reach our friends and family more intimately than any news media ever can.
 
* **Facebook**: Use videos and add banners to them or add subtitles to the video. Videos on Facebook spread faster. Be sure to upload videos directly to Facebook so that it can spread faster on the social media. Direct people in the video (or if you are using someone else's video: the description under video) to [Battle For The Net](https://battleforthenet.com). Keep description short and straight to the point.

* **Instagram:** Use pictures on Instagram. Use 15 second videos to tell people why net neutrality important to the Internet. Use the picture to direct people to go to [Battle For The Net](https://battleforthenet.com)


* **Twitter:** Take whatever content that you have created in order to have it spread it further. With Twitter  you will have to spread it farther and repeatedly. Have the content spread with the hashtags #netneutrality; #stoptheFCC; #breaktheinternet


* **Gab.io:** I don't know much about this social media platform but you can focus on posting there. The more outside you guys are  the better.


* **4chan**: 4chan likes to try experiments in getting themselves noticed. Post about net neutrality. Don't push the issue but invite them to help.


* **Other Subreddits:** Create a relevant topics that can also relate to subreddit that you are in.


* **Minds.io:** Get people to discuss their opinions on Minds.io and get them interested in spreading the news about net neutrality in a way that is educated.


* **YouTube:** Create videos about YouTube. [This person did a great job at making the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLGMp8x3rA4&t=6s) **Don't forget to spread your videos to everyone on multiple social media platforms  multiple times throughout the day.**



**Short Meme Videos**: The shorter the message  the farther the message. **This is why I continue to express: **NET NEUTRALITY IS ONLINE FREE SPEECH.**


 
* Even if you are shitty video creator  you can still make meme videos. You can easily make a meme.


* Even if you still feel that you can't make a meme  you can still spread funny memes all over the Internet.


* You can use funny videos to get people to go to [Battle for The Net](https://battleforthenet.com)

 **Memes**: Memes are great because you can say what you want to say to your audience in a short amount of time.
 
* **Humor**: You can use memes to make people laugh. ""Do you want your websites to be blocked? Then FUCK NET NEUTRALITY!"" Humor gets people interested.


* **Educated:** You can use memes to educate people quickly - use less than 10 words and use specific examples. For example: ""Title II prevents Comcast from gouging you.""


* **Combat Misinformation**: If you have been hearing misinformation about Title II  you can use memes to combat that. **""Net neutrality lets Facebook and Google control the Internet. People can choose to not use Facebook and Google.""**


* **Action-Engaging**: You can use messages like  ""Don't let Ajit Pai destroy the Internet. Go call your Senator and your Representative"".

* **The Expedient Nature of the Internet**: The Internet makes really fast. This is one advantage that Internet has over everything.


* **Our Smartphones**: People have their smartphones. They carry them whereever they go. We can easily reach people where they are.


* **Sense of Action**: The action required to do what is very small but once people know about what Ajit Pai has done  make the action they have to do be relatively small.


* **We Can Speak To Our Audience  News Media Can't**: We can 24/7 access to their audience. We can reach out to them and even answer their questions about net neutrality.


* **Our Reach Is Stronger Than The News Media**: We know our circle of friends and family more closely. Mention it in passing.


* **Other Net Neutrality Videos**: Other people have been made better videos. [This one is a good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtt2aSV8wdw).  [So is this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggasfCOmQK8).  [And so is this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd27PgNJNIo) Don't have time to make your net neutrality video  **just a good one  especially the ones already listed here.


* **Senators and Representatives:** Senators want to keep their job. Some Senators are decent people and other are corrupt. You can convince the corrupt Senators and Reps to change their minds by reminding them that they are not going to keep their job when elections are coming. Some of these guys sold for $500. **Also  for the Senators and Representatives who are fighting the good fight for you  give them a call and thank them.** It's a thankless job. :)


* **Most Importantly  Use BATTLEfortheNET.com as CALL-TO-ACTION in all Your ACTION**: Get people  especially in the Red States  to call their Senators and their Representatives about Title II oversight in the link that has the description in it by having them go to [Battle For The Net.](https://battleforthenet.com)

**SOLUTIONS**: So what can we do about this.?
 
* **Organized Movement**: I am creating an organized movement to educate and convert people into saving net neutrality called #mala. Perhaps  you can create a movement of your own.

* **One  Short  Straightforward Messages**: Use short messages that are straight to the point. They spread farther and they are easier to be remember.


* **Keep The Messages Short**: I can't stress this enough. The shorter the messages  the simple language the better. Use 4th-grade English when you are creating your memes and your videos. (**[No  they are not stupid where they can can't understand anything but shorter messages spread faster. This action plan is written in 4th-grade English as a good example to use. If you are still confused  use this.](http://gunning-fog-index.com/))


* **Get The 'Normies' Angry and Direct That Anger To Take Action**: Get outside of your circle of friends who are tech-savvy already. Talk to people who are not always online all the time  too or more interested in mainstream news. Keep the conversation simple  **""Would you pay more for the same Internet""**


* **Get The 'Normies' Associated:** Only tech-savvy people seem to be freaking out about this. We need to drive a larger controversy where normal people have to contact the ""normies"" in their lives about the Internet.


* **Understand that the News Had Ignored Us Before**: The mainstream news is compromised by the ISP's. You have to spread the news in our playground: the Internet. We know the social media platforms like the back of our hand. We can abuse the spread of news about net neutrality.


* **Get The News To Fight Us  FAST:** Using controversy is the best way to make this happen. I am aware that Ajit Pai is the pawn but driving focus to his actions is the key to getting some controversy. He has plenty of reasons to go about  too.


* **Partner Up with Social Media 'Microphones:** Leverage the voices with those who have larger audiences than you. Their words will reach more people than yours ever could. Contact YouTubers  podcasters  social media personalities about net neutrality and how it affects them.


* **Contact Businesses To Do Surprise Sales  Program for Net Neutrality**: Business have stake in having unlimited customer reach and not having to deal with unpredictable overhead.


* **Contact YouTubers to Talk About Net Neutrality**: Contact YouTubers about net neutrality and ask them to do a video about net neutrality. **Be sure to have your sources ready so that they can easily talk about the net neutrality.**


* **THE ONLY CTA is Calling Senators and Representatives**: The most important thing is getting people to call their Senators and their Representatives right away. This is the only action that needs to be taken.

__________________________________

**TOO LONG/DIDN'T READ**: This is the (somewhat) short version. I do want the whole thing to be read but if you could  you can read just this and read few sections at a time.

**SUGGESTED TACTICS**
 
* **Use branded content **(mainstream shows/movies that everyone watches)** to bring awareness:** Use branded mainstream media content that everyone already knows as memes or videos. They spread faster and they get people excited about net neutrality. Make sure that you use that meme to direct people to [Battle For The Net.](https://battleforthenet.com)


* **Abuse Ajit Pai's Mean Tweets video:** Create a short meme video where you can upload on Facebook. Use white banner bars over this video about Ajit Pai doing a Mean Tweets video. **Top BANNER: ""AJIT PAI WANTS TO MAKE YOU PAY MORE FOR THE INTERNET"" BOTTOM BANNER: ""DON'T LET HIM! CALL YOUR SENATORS and YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.**


* **Most importantly  use CTA in messages: Call Senate and Representatives**: The most thing about to stress out is to use media to convert your audience into going to [Battle for the Net.](https://battleforthenet.com) This is very important. The conversion drives the traffic to the right Senators and the Representatives.


* **Bring relevance to net neutrality in a creative way:**  Use popular media like **The Office  The Simpsons  Final Fantasy VII  Super Mario Bros.  and other **POPULAR MEDIA** to spread the message across the social media networks.


* **Use short facts about FFC and net neutrality. Use 4th grade-level English.** Keep the language simple and straight-to-the-point. There is a reason why Ajit Pai keeps saying  ""Take the Internet out of the hands of bueracrats and into entrepreneurs and engineers. Our sound bite is ""**NET NEUTRALITY IS FREE SPEECH**"". It's simple  proven  and hard to debate against.


* **Use humor  entertainment  suspense  sex appeal to get people intrigued and interesting.** People are busy so using net neutrality in a way gets people excited and funny. **What if you are talentless?** Share another video if someone who is talented! [This video is a great example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JucFpDhuF98)


* **Contact businesses and content creators**: Businesses and content creators have interest in keeping net neutrality alive. You can contact them about net neutrality and make the research phase the most easiest phase when you compile the evidence that they need to look through. **Bonus points if you can summarize each source you give to them.**


* **Educate yourself**: Understand the history behind ISP's. It's a confusing history but you have to do your research so you can explain to the next person why you think net neutrality is proven.


* **To maximize spread  upload your content in the early morning**: I have been testing this out to some great results. Keep uploading (and re-uploading the same content) in the early morning. I don't know why exactly but it spreads faster this way.

**ACTION PLAN:**
 
* **Put down the Shotgun  Use Your Rifle**: It's time to stay aiming at anything that moves and being reactive. We need to be proactive. Calling Senators and Representatives do help but we need to aim our rifles at the general public. Get them to call their Senators and their Representatives.


* **Aim at the Right Targets**: The right targets are getting the average person motivated to call the Senators and their Representatives.


* **Use the Call-to-Action To Leverage Against the FCC**: The only action that we ask our audience to do is to contact their Senators and their Representatives. [Battle For The Net](https://battleforthenet.com)


* **Use Researchers who Know Everything about Net Neutrality**: Team up with researchers who understand net neutrality thoroughly! Use them as a reference to understand all about net neutrality.


* **Spark Some Controversy**: It's still key that we get on the news about this. Spread Ajit Pai about net neutrality. Not everyone knows how important net neutrality is to them. So  reaching out beyond just our circles is **critical**.


* **Use Condensed Messages**: Keep your messages engaging  short  straight-to-the-point when speaking about net neutrality.


* **Use Mainstream Media**: Use **Breaking Bad  Mad Men  Mr. Robot  Big Bang Theory  The Simpsons  Futurama  Star Wars  Parks and Recreation  Spongebob Squarepants**   and other **POPULAR** media to spread your messages about net neutrality. It spreads faster and farther. **ALWAYS put the call-to-action in there.** Always  always direct people into calling their Senators and their Representative - especially if they are Republican.

* **LEVERAGE AJIT PAI AGAINST HIMSELF**: The best way that you convert the bystander to your side is to convince them that Ajit Pai hates America and currently lying to the American people now. [This Mean Tweets video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBt84HNAGwU) should do the trick. 

* **Pictures and Videos Spread More**: Use pictures and short videos to spread news about net neutrality.

**READ THE BLUEPRINT AS A GUIDELINE:**

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by buying everyone an AncestryDNA kit and ruining Christmas,"Earlier this year  AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition  and I gave my mom  dad  brother  and 2 sisters each a kit. 

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time  my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals  but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

Fast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour  and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

TL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

Update:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters  brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are  we will still love each other  and our parents no matter what. 

Update 2: CHRISTMAS ISN’T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life  and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time  and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes  we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!

P.S. Sorry my mom isn’t a whore. No you’re not my daddy. ",Snorkels721,12-25-2018,False,1545730602.0,False,False,False,8971,20,12,,161829,0
/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.,"The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim  just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT  it literally is the best fan I’ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house  the unit cost over $400 so I didn’t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn’t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day  and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It’s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark  this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did  I decided to try one last time with another bulb because  however unlikely  it’s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I’m up there installing the new bulb  grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I’m turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”. 

Fuck me. 

TL;DR

For 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken  but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",moby323,01-27-2019,False,False,False,False,False,2584,10,6,,137932,0
/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.,"Today was the day I realised I messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts  I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing  I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway  I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers  if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant  I'm still in my own little Truman show)

If you're procrastinating (and let's face it  you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

TL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

Edit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx

Edit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!

Please dont be too sad about this  i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)

Edit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods  its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.

I also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape  some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing  like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support  even a stranger can help.

I love all of you weirdos <3

Edit 4: No more I promise. I'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. I'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. I created an /AMA when this thread went down  if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes  gaming  mental health  parenting etc then keep in touch.

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by owning a Golden Retriever while being Black.,"Sigh. 

Work was rough today and all I wanted to do afterward was to sit on the couch and let the TV watch me while eating food not cooked by my own hands. The answer to that? Delivery. 

Food ordered  I let the dog into the yard to burn some energy and sat camped outside with him while waiting for the delivery. Doordash  Grubhub  Uber and everyone other than Jehovah's Witnesses has trouble locating my address strictly relying on GPS so it's nothing for me to post up and wait outside for when they are close  flag them down and go back inside for a contactless drop-off. 

Pertinent details before shit hits the fan; my neighbor and I share a fence with a doggy door as our pups are super close and you can bet each time that if my dog is outside  hers will follow for cross-yard playtime. This was the case today and probably bad judgement on my part to think that I would be able to break up the fun quickly. 

Both dogs were in the neighbor’s yard at the time the notification came through that the driver was pulling up and I had to call out a few times to get my dog’s attention. Neighbor thankfully whistled for her dog and I had to put on the ”voice” for mine to acknowledge I existed and then took off running for my door while waving to the driver who by this point was getting out of the car. 

Pup and I have a game called Runaway where I will take off yelling ”RUNAWAY” and literally he will chase after me like some human sized fetch-stick. I use this to my advantage until he realized I was putting him inside but managed to get him through the storm door and close the screen before he could run out. Then realized that I'd left the gate locked like an idiot with the driver standing right outside by this point. 

I didn't have a mask on at this point and neither did she so I yelled from the porch that she could leave the food by the mailbox and that is where the fun started. 

”Is that your dog?”

My bullshit meter didn't go off. I thought she was asking a question with an obvious answer because duh  she was a dog person so I engaged with dog-owner gushiness. Yes; blah  blah  blah... His name is XYZ... Wanna say hi? 

I’ll be nice because you brought my food. 

But she just stood there awkwardly for a moment  put the food down and quickly jumped back into her car. In my mind I was like  ”okay weird” but whatever. Snatched the food and went back inside. Went to wash my hands and from the kitchen window  I can see the full street where she is still parked outside. Thinking “okay weird...” again but didn’t dwell on it too much figuring that she was looking at the route to her next location. 

I went about my business of preparing to destroy my meal. Few minutes later  the dog begins barking manically at the door. I take a glance at the cameras and realize she is still out front parked directly in front of my mailbox. 

Uh...ok? What’s going on here?

I go outside and try to get her attention but she is on the phone and doesn’t notice me. I walk up like I’m going to check the mail and she does pull off  but towards the back of the neighborhood that only has one way in and one way out. Lots of people make that mistake and so you’ll quickly see cars turning back around but she never came back. By this time  I think I’m losing my mind so I go back in but still watching the street for the car to pass. It never does. 

I don’t know  people are weird so I just left it at that and went back to eat. About ten minutes later  dog starts going ham at the door so I check the cameras to see two police cars sitting outside my house. 

I continue to watch the cameras realizing that yup  the cops are getting out of the car and walking back and forth in front of mine and neighbor’s yards. I go out to see if anything is wrong and they introduce themselves before saying they were called because a stolen Golden Retriever was reported at my address and if there was a dog in the home. 

It clicked that Driver had called the police and then explained my version of what happened. They were really respectful and apologetic but asked if I could get Sir Pup. I went ahead and opened the door for the dog who took off  ready to greet the new faces outside. His collar has tags matching the address with my name and phone number on it in case he was ever lost or stolen which was proof enough for them as it was obvious that they wanted to get this over as fast as possible. 

No hard feelings on either side  we were all walking away when Driver’s car slowly comes creeping from the back of the neighborhood. I yelled out to them that the lady was right there and they positioned themselves in front of her car in a way she would have to stop and speak with them. 

I don’t know if this lady was drunk or off her meds but she rolled down the window and was literally sobbing hysterically that she saw me take the dog from the neighbor’s yard  that animals get no justice and the icing on the cake? MY KIND only owns Pittbulls and Rottweilers. There was no way he was mine and needed to be protected. I honestly did not want to deal with that mess so sorry guys  this isn’t a tale of revenge; I went back inside and stayed the fuck on my couch. My day was already shitty. Everyone left a few minutes after that so I assume she got a warning. 

However  I did report the incident to the delivery service and was offered credits towards my next meal. 

I splurged that on a bakery and now am currently fucking up a slice of carrot cake  grateful it didn’t end worse. 

TL; DR

Ordered food  racist delivery person thought I stole my own Golden Retriever and had a breakdown when I didn’t get carted off in handcuffs. Didn’t get shot but got cake in the end.

Edit: Wow  Reddit! Waking up to the massive amounts of love and well wishes was amazing! Thank you so much for your kind words! I am going to do my best and go through every comment and private message. I wish I could share this cake with all of you! Carrot cake lovers unite! Happy to share this pile of awards with other great posts and comments!

Taking the sound advice to keep a close eye on the dog when he goes out. Will also share with neighbor just in case! My husband did agree with many of you to seek further action against the delivery driver but I’m pretty torn on whether to do so. Things are hard out here for all of us including the less savory members of our community but I will take the day to think on the next steps.

I’ve removed all of this personal story for my family’s protection and changed this account’s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.

I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night  this guy is incredibly living in another world!

I’m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it  that these types of scumbags DO NOT.

I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright  but I was keeping it in for the next morning.

Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn’t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom  he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn’t “fun camping” or a “picnic”.

This morning  before he woke-up  we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

I’m not seeing him anymore  going to lawyer up  give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable  and divorce his ass.

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by wearing a shawl  which ruined my relationship with my GF,"Minor background: I am a pretty affectionate  and at times  effeminate  dude. I'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that I was in special forces a while ago  and my roommates all served as well  but I also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. I'm not gay  I just am me.

So while I was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. Mine makes me look like a Star Wars character and his looks like the Outlaw Josey Wales  these are seriously awesome shawls. The first night we wore them  everybody at the dive bar we went to (Re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. Then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from Shawlbro  and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. Like  acting pretty weird about them and making comments. Whatever. So I get a call from my GF  she's tired and wants to hang out at mine  and so I bid these mean girls and Shawlbro adieu and head home.

I'm still wearing the shawl when my GF arrives and she's also really taken aback  she won't even kiss me until I take it off. We get do the deed and go to sleep  and the next morning she starts asking me if I'm gay. And she's really serious and aggressive about it. I tell her I'm not  that if I was I'd definitely know if by now  and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that I own a shawl. Anyway she gets weird and leaves  and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants  and then doesn't contact me for days. So yesterday I invite her out  she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to The Big City  but that she doesn't know this or that  and eventually I just tell her very politely to get fucked because I'm pretty insulted by this point. On the way back  now that I'm not directly in front of her  I get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah  she's just not that into me anymore because I wore a shawl.

Later on  I tell Shawlbro about this  and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

We are both going to keep wearing the shawls though  they are warm.

Tl;dr: Me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.

They banned me on r/AskReddit for it.

I posted about it on here and changed my name to r/NazisStoleMyBirthday

r/AskReddit unbanned me.

This post blew up and got really popular. It got me a 3 day suspension from Reddit for circumventing my ban on r/AskReddit

This morning I found out that somehow this post got changed to contain a ton of really inappropriate racial and homophobic slurs along with threats of violence. This was not me. I have no idea how that happened.

Some of you won’t believe this and I understand that. I would be skeptical myself if I were you. For what it’s worth  I would never say things that  much less think them. My intention was to simply share my story and it blew up way more than I thought it would. Some misguided soul thought it would be good to change the post and mess the whole thing up. I take responsibility for what happens on my account  but this statements were not made by me. Obviously they have upset a lot of people and I wish I could meet each of you face to face to apologize.

This was not a stunt to try and get karma or awards. Again  some won’t believe that and that’s ok.

If you care  you can look at my original post on r/Banned to see where I was trying to understand why my name was offensive. You can also look at my post and comment history on this account and my new one to see that this was very clearly not me.

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by swiping on my girlfriend’s phone NSFW,"So this happened a few days ago and I’m still not sure I’m 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She’s perfect for me. We’re perfect for eachother. We’re getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

We went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

She went to the bathroom while I had her phone  and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I’m talking about  you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you’re back at the start of the photo album. It’s annoying as hell.

But some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn’t be seeing  of her and a previous boyfriend.

There she is  the love of my life  TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve watched porn - a lot. I’ve never seen a dick like this. I’m talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

I could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

I closed the pictures and I’ve acted like nothing has happened  but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I’ve never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I’m significantly above average  but this has destroyed my self esteem.

We haven’t had sex since. I can’t concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.

TL;DR accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

and then on the next page  it says. Enter your credit card . I'm already skeptical but it says.. it's 100% free  it's only for if things get hot and you wanna donate

and I'm like.. eeeeehhh... but I'm already so far in the process that I'm like ok fuck it.. let's go

So now I'm in and I watch a few and they're like just sitting there  they're not really doing anything. nobody was showing any tits  a little ass shaking  but pretty underwhelming overall.

So to find the best one I just hold control on my keyboard and open a ton of tabs so I can find one that actually does something sexy.

and I flip through these tabs at the top and it would popup this annoying thing that said. You can only watch one live stream at the time. 

this popup would come a few times where I had to click like an orange button to refresh.

and then I land on this really old like 60-year-old gilf  and she's just sitting there  there's like 8 people watching live.

then there was a popup with an orange button and instinctively my mouse just goes to it and right as I'm about to click the button I see it says  enter private room $5 dollars.

I click it  and I'm like.. ""No! o fuck!"" I'm not sad loosing $5 dollars but eh  couldn't it be somebody that's a little bit sexier?

Now she's like smiling and she say's ""heeey Jakob"".. Immediately she's pulling her tits out and she grabs a dildo laying next to her. she has this underwear on that has like a velcro flap  and she snaps it open and I can see this really old  slightly hairy pussy. 

I'm like.. alright man  I fucking paid for this  so better give it a go  kinda like shamefully jacking off.

Now she keeps saying Jakob over and over again  moaning  and I mean.. she puts on a pretty good show  she was pretty hot  but I mean she's fucking 60...

I start writing in the chat that she should talk dirty to me and shit. 

I'm gonna spare you all the details  but after a few minutes I cum

and I'm like  thank you  bye! 

I Close the window and go back to watching youtube and chilling out.

Later that night  I go to check my email  and I see this receipt from pornhub live and it turns out... it didn't cost just $5... It cost $5 dollars per minute!!

So that's how I spent $72 dollars on a 60-year-old woman calling me Jakob

/r/history/,history,My Jewish-American grandfather guarded Nazis in WW2 France. After the war  one his prisoners sent him this illustrated book of his time in the camp.,"My grandfather-in-law was a Jewish-American Officer who oversaw a German POW camp in WW2 France. ""Pop"" treated everyone with respect and was quite popular as a result. Years after the war he received this illustrated book from one of his prisoners in the mail.

I found it rummaging through my in-law's basement this past weekend and wanted to share what I perceived to be a good primary source of history with the community. In light of the ""on all sides"" rhetoric I found this to be a poignant reminder of how people on opposing sides (literally  Hitler) could come together.

I never had a chance to meet Pop  but from what I'm told he was a gentleman and a scholar who was even more popular with the ladies than he was with the Nazis.

**Here is the book:**

*Edit: Many of you have asked about what type of person ""Pop"" was so I wanted to share some anecdotes from his granddaughter (my fiance):

* He deeply cared about the happiness of other people and always put them before himself.
* He was a Lifemaster of Bridge.
* He loved getting mail so much he would sign up for mailers and then gave the gifts away.
* He was always honest and told you exactly how he felt  but was nice about it.
* He constantly made new friends throughout his life and was a popular gentleman.
* He died in 2004 at the age of 83 after a long battle with cancer.",Accidentally_Upvotes,08-19-2017,False,1503098465.0,False,False,False,1726,0,2,,33453,0
/r/history/,history,/r/history is closing down for the next 24 hours in response to current events and reddit's response as a platform,"After some discussion the /r/history mod team has decided to follow other subreddits [like /r/AskHistorians ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gvji7z/askhistorians_is_closing_to_new_posts_from_830_pm/) in closing down the subreddit. 

/r/history is not accepting new posts or responses  in protest against Reddit’s lack of action against racism and hate on the site.

Reddit has announced [its alignment with antiracist protesters](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106?s=20). We demand to know: where are the actions to back up the words? The Reddit administrators’ policies have made their site downright hospitable to exactly the kinds of racists and fascists against whom it claims to be protesting. 

Every day our sub  which has zero tolerance for such speech  has to remove the kinds of intensely problematic and hateful rhetoric that Reddit has become a safe haven for. For example  questions and answers supporting Holocaust denial forced us to establish a clear policy of immediate deletion  as /r/AskHistorians moderator /u/commiespaceinvader describes [here](https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/the-askhistorians-subreddit-banned-holocaust-deniers-and-facebook-should-too.html).

In fact  a majority of the work we do here as moderators on /r/history goes into making sure that racists and people with other toxic ideologies don't have a platform on this subreddit. 

Later today /r/AskHistorians  will be issuing a thorough statement on the long history of police brutality against the Black community.

Today  Silvertongue is a published novel!,"Edit - [Audiobook info here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Inorai/comments/bcjzwp/silvertongues_audiobook_is_now_live/)

Good morning!

Like the post says  seven months ago I found myself responding to a prompt -

>[**”Whenever you speak  people hear you speaking in their native language. Most people are surprised and delighted. The cashier at McDonalds you've just talked to is horrified. ""Nobody's spoken that language in thousands of years.""**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8tmkfc/wp_whenever_you_speak_people_hear_you_speaking_in/)

One thing led to another  stuff got a little out of hand  and...well…

Here we are!

Today I’m here to share the publishing of Silvertongue  a novel based off that prompt.  Taken from the back of the book -

>After another long day at work  all Jon Christensen wanted was a cheap burger and some peace and quiet.

>When he pulled into the McDonald’s  Jon only had the usual cares on his mind. His sister. The bills. A career with seemingly nowhere to go.

>But after a confusing encounter at the cash register triggers a violent episode in the parking lot  he’s quickly pulled into a world he doesn’t understand. His few careless sentences - and the odd gift of languages he’s kept hidden for years - wind up thrusting him right into the middle of a chaotic magical free-for-all  a battle taking place in the shadows of society. Entangled in an increasingly complex web of violence and lies  he's left with a choice: adapt  or die.

>Surrounded by strangers  Jon must struggle to survive  searching out friends amidst a sea of foes. If he can get his group of strays and rejects to work together  there’s a chance they might just make it out alive.

>Should he fail  the consequences will be dire - not only for Jon  but also for those he loves.

I’ll also share a few quick bits about the book:

Silvertongue is an urban fantasy  with heavy action/thriller elements.

- The cover art was done by /u/IsmaelGil - Go check their stuff out!  [It’s wonderful!](https://www.ochentayochoart.com/)

- In its final form  Silvertongue is just over 220 000 words long.  It’s a big boy.

- It is the first book in a new series  Remnants of Magic  which will likely run anywhere from three to five books long.  I’m not good at estimating.

- Silvertongue is my fifth published novel  and RoM is the second series I’ve written!

**If you are interested in reading Silvertongue  then** [**here is a link to where it can be found on Amazon as an ebook!**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NTR9YY4)

[Join the mailing list and get notified for book 2's release!](http://eepurl.com/gpmbG5)

Edit -
The ebook is $2.99  and the paperback will be $15.99.  Since these are eligible for Kindle Unlimited  it will likely display the book as 'free' - if you look below the header  you can see a ""Buy for 2.99"" option.  That's how you buy the ebook.

Be careful what you choose.

Generally  people are expected to ponder their decisions carefully. We spend months working through the important moments in our lives. Years. We’re expected to be thoughtful when we pick a job  when we decide who to date  when we find a place to live.

I wasn’t any different. I’d thought that I was a pretty cautious person  overall. Not exactly the high-risk type  you might say. Others would probably have just called me boring and been done with it.

But sometimes  sneaking in when you least expect it  a single decision can change everything.

“I already told you  Keira. I’m tired. I just want to come home. Today sucked.”

“Yeah  I get that. But I don’t want pizza. It’s right on the way  so why’s it a big deal? Just swing through and pick us up something.” My sister’s voice had all the smug confidence I’d long since come to expect  even over the phone.

I swallowed a groan. The road flew past under my tires  leading me from the run-down office I worked at back towards home. I gripped my cell phone a little tighter  scowling. “I don’t *want* McDonald’s. I just want to sit on the couch and have dinner brought to me for once  okay?”

“That’s lazy.”

“So?”

“So I want a burger. You should bring me home something.”

I rolled my eyes  feeling my teeth grind together. She’d win. She knew she was going to win  which was why she sounded so damn happy with herself.

Fine. So be it. It was just food  after all  and if I didn’t bring anything home I knew she’d just whine and complain for the rest of the night. Shutting her up was worth the hassle  I decided.

“Whatever. Okay.”

“Great. Don’t forget the fries.” She didn’t even wait for me to say goodbye before she hung up.
I shoved my phone back into my pocket  muttering darkly to myself. The plaintive chirp of the low-battery warning fell quiet under the thick layers of fabric. Hitting the brakes  I turned back towards the few restaurants clinging to life along the edge of town.

It was *just food*. If I’d have known the mess it’d make  maybe I’d have decided differently. Maybe I’d have put up with the complaining and gone home  settling in with the box of delivery pizza I so desperately wanted. Maybe I’d have approached the whole situation with a little more care. But I didn’t know - and there was no way that I could have ever guessed the chain of events that we’d set into motion.

My mind was a blur as I slid out into the cold  walking towards the front door. Drive-through would have been faster  almost certainly. But if my sister was going to make me play personal chauffeur  then it was my obligation to at least make it painful for her. She could wait while I ate my dinner. Fair was fair.

Chuckling to myself  I made my way through the motions of ordering  operating entirely on automatic. My head ached. It had been a long day. There had been not one but *two* irate clients  all demanding total reworks on their projects. I hadn’t spent years in school so that I could deal with assholes all day. Reality didn’t seem to have gotten the memo.

“What did you say?”

I paused  my card already jammed into the receptacle and deducting the bill from my bank account. The world spun around me as I blinked myself back to awareness. “What?”

The clerk stared at me  his green eyes narrowed. I drew half a step back almost unconsciously  trying to remember exactly what I’d been doing or what I’d said that somehow had set the man off. “Uh. I asked if I could have my drink cup. You guys keep making us wait and it’s kind of annoying.”

The man stared at me  his lips pressed into a thin line. “What are you *doing?”*

All right  the guy was clearly crazy. I tore my debit card free  shoving it back into my wallet. “I’m trying to get a Big Mac. Is that a problem?”

“Are you insane?” he hissed  leaning forward across the counter. “What are you doing?”

“Greg?” someone called from across the store. A manager  judging by the color of their uniform. Their voice was carefully cheerful. “What’s going on?”

“Nothing! Just helping this gentleman out ” Greg said  his face snapping back to carefully neutral as he smiled at me. The cashier shoved a plastic cup into my hands  along with the paper slip of my receipt. “Look - don’t be an idiot ” he said  his voice dropping low enough I had to lean in to hear him. “I don’t know what game you think you’re playing  but you can’t walk in here talking gibberish. Leave me alone.”

I stared at him  my mind racing  but the customers behind me were already pushing forward. I stepped back to join the others waiting for their food  my mind churning.

I had a bit of a gift. Well  that’s how I liked to think about it. It had taken a few years to figure out - all languages sounded exactly the same to me. No matter if I was speaking to someone blabbering on in French or chattering in Italian  it all came across as plain old English.

My parents had been freaked out  understandably. It had taken a bit of doing to convince them I wasn’t just crazy. And as soon as we’d pieced together what was going on  we’d begun hiding whatever it was I was doing. It wasn’t as though I could suddenly start spouting off Spanish and German  after all. We couldn’t even just leave copies of Rosetta Stone lying around meaningfully. The instant someone I actually *knew* called me on it  the secret would be up. I kind of valued living a normal life too much to allow something like that to happen.

Tray in hand and my mediocre food steaming  I filed back to my seat. I could feel Greg’s eyes on me the whole way - staring.

What was his problem? Had I stuttered? And what had he meant  gibberish? Maybe he spoke a different language  sure  but why would that be a problem? He should be happy that I’d spoken Polish or Swahili or who-gives-a-fuck. Maybe a bit surprised  but not *angry*. His reaction wasn’t normal at all.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Normally I would have lingered  taking my time in eating. With the feeling of Clerk Asshat’s glare boring holes in the back of my neck  I just wanted to leave. I shoveled my meal down as quickly as I could  hardly tasting it. My phone lit up with notifications  friends and family blabbering away in text messages and group chats. All of them wanted to know where I was. When I’d be finished with the day’s chores. Keira pinged me again  still asking after her damn burger.

I ignored all of them. The wrapper crumpled instantly in my hand as I pushed myself upright  dumping the whole lot of it in the trash. Grabbing the to-go bag with her food  I turned for the door.

The guy wasn’t at the counter anymore. A sigh of relief slipped out of me as I saw his station replaced by a tiny  grinning brunette. Good. Maybe his manager had finally taken him down a notch.

The lights on my sedan blinked across the parking lot at me as I stepped out of the store. The cold air snapped me awake  back to reality in an instant. I was letting that guy creep me out for no reason. He was just a jerk  that was all - trapped in his minimum wage job. Probably just a crazy  when I thought about it. He was probably just-

I yelped  my eyes widening as fingers buried themselves in my hair. The bag of food fell to the pavement. Someone had me. There was something cold at my throat - cold and sharp.

“Ok  asshole ” Greg hissed in my ear  his voice wild. “We’re going to go for a walk.”

“What the *fuck* are you-”

“Shut up.”
The blade dug into my neck. I could feel a hot line of blood dripping down my skin. My mind raced - this was insane. He really was crazy. A lunatic. He was-

There was nothing I could do to fight him as he turned me  forcing me towards the rear of the store. A dingy  beat-up station wagon waited in the back corner  the lot unlit and dismally dark. I scanned the scene even still  ready to bellow for help at a moment’s notice.

It was useless. There was no one around. No one was going to hear.

He slammed me into the back of the car  my face pressed painfully against the glass.

“How stupid do you think I am?” he spat.

“What the *hell* are you talking about?” I cried. My fingers trembled.

“What  you think you’re being subtle? You’ll just walk in  talking the old tongue like you were born to it  and I’ll roll over for you?”

“Look  dude  there’s been some mistake ” I moaned. “It’s-It’s just something that I can do  all right? It’s not-”

“Right ” he said with a laugh  his fingers still pulling painfully at my hair. “Like I’m going to believe that.”

“I speak a lot of languages  all right?” I said  craning my head until I could look at him. “That’s all. I don’t know what you heard. All I know is-”

“How long until they get here?”

Confusion bubbled up in my mind. “What?”

“I’m not stupid ” he spat. “I’m not going to sit idly until they come to finish the job. How long until the rest of them show up?”

“The rest of *who?*” I said  trying desperately to keep from crying.

“You know damn well who-” he said  but stopped abruptly.

I blinked  my breath catching in my throat.

Somewhere in the distance  sirens were approaching.

My heart leapt. Police. *Yes*. Someone must have seen him  someone must have called the cops. I was saved. He’d-

He let go of my hair in an instant  leaping away. Abandoning the car and I  he vanished into the underbrush of the woods behind the McDonald’s. I fell in a crumpled heap  my heart still pounding in my ears.

Tires screeched as the cop car pulled up moments later  a pair of officers piling out.

“Sir! Sir  are you all right?” one yelled  racing over to me. His dark hair was in disarray  in contrast to his short-trimmed beard. “Can you tell me what happened?”

“There was- a man ” I said  glancing back at the woods. ‘H-He had a knife. He was crazy. Thought I was speaking some funny language or something.”

“Why would he think that?” the cop’s partner said  his brow furrowing. He stared at me  leaning closer like he could see straight into my soul.

“I-I don’t know ” I said  instinctively clamping down. The cops paused  eerily quiet.

“What  that’s it?” the first said.

“I’m sorry ” I muttered  unable to meet their eyes. My gaze drifted  needing to find something  anything else to look at. The flashing lights of their cars drew my eyes in  holding my gaze.
I froze.

“Well  look. I’m sure this has been a traumatic event. Why don’t you come back with us  and we’ll talk about it?” the second said  smiling blankly at me. One hand dropped to his belt. He was a heavy-set man  short and broad. I wouldn’t have expected an officer to look like him  the thoughts in the back of my head whispered.

Neither of them was wearing a radio. There was nothing hanging off his waist but a gun and a pair of handcuffs. The details of it stuck out like a lightning flash in my mind.

I took a step back.

“Don’t worry  all right?” the first said  beaming at me. “You’re safe now  right?”

The insignia on their car was wrong. I’d lived in the town my entire life  and it was *wrong*. It didn’t even have the right *name* on it. It just looked…

Generic.

I took another step back.

The smiles were beginning to fade from their faces.

“Come on ” the first said. “Just take it easy  ok? We’ll just go for a ride.”

His hand reached out  grabbing for my elbow. I skittered away before he could touch me  suddenly sure of two things.

Whoever those two were  they were *not* police officers.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,My sugar daddy asks me for weird favors,"His Tinder profile said he was 45  but he looked to be in his early thirties at most. 

*Looking for a sugar baby. $700 weekly. No sex.* 

It sounded too good to be true  but  as a broke university student  I was willing to take my chances. I swiped right  and Tinder let me know it was a match. His message came seconds later. 

**Hey  there sweetheart :)**

I cringed at that word  I hated it  but seven hundred dollars was seven hundred dollars  so I sucked it up and replied. 

**Hey ;)** 

His name was Jack  and he told me he owned his own business  although he never specified what kind of business it was. We talked for a while before he asked me for my Venmo to send me the first payment. 

After a few minutes  I got the notification. I stared at the $700 for at least twenty minutes  expecting to wake up from a dream at any second. But it wasn’t a dream. 

**You still there?** 

I clicked on the message. 

**Yeah. Sorry. If you don’t mind me asking  what are you looking for in return?** 

I stared at the chat until he replied. 

**I’m just looking for you to do a few favors for me :)**

That sounded like it was going to be sexual to me. 

**Like what?**

**For example  the first thing I need you to do is pick up a delivery for me.** 

That sounded innocent enough  but I was still expecting there to be some kind of twist. Seven-hundred dollars to pick up a package? Come on  even I wasn’t that naive. 

**From the post office or something?** 

**No.  I’ll send you the address  but I’d rather not do this through Tinder. You got Kik? Or you can give me your number.**

Kik? What was this  2011? I decided to give him my number instead  and he texted me the address immediately  followed by the address to his house  where I would have to drop off the package. 

**I’m not home right now  but there’s a key on the bottom of the blue flower pot near the door. Go inside and put the package on the coffee table in the living room. Make sure that you lock the door when you go inside the house  and then lock it again when you leave.** 

I grabbed my car keys and wallet and got into my car  putting the address into Google maps. 

**Got it! Omw.** 

My phone buzzed as I backed out of my driveway. 

**I’m serious. Lock the door BOTH times. Please.** 

I thought that was a little excessive  but I promised him that I would. 

The house looked abandoned. It had a broken chain link fence around it  with a small door that was hanging onto dear life. It stuck out like a sore thumb  surrounded by houses that were a lot nicer than this one in comparison. 

“You here for Jack’s shit?”

I looked up to see a man standing in the open doorway of the house. He took up almost the entire space  his head skimming the top of the door frame. He was huge; in height and muscles  and his entire torso was covered in tattoos. 

“Uh  yeah. I guess.” I replied  not moving from my spot on the sidewalk. 

“Stay right there.” He said. 

I did. I actually don’t think I would have moved if he had asked me to. I looked around and realized that there was no one else on this street. I was a twenty-one-year-old woman alone in the street. I gripped my car keys. 

A few minutes later  the man came back out carrying a cardboard box. It was about the size of a shoebox  but stained and damp on some of the corners. 

“Can you open your car?” He asked. 

I opened the trunk  not wanting that inside on my car seats and he set it in. 

“Alright  there you go.” He said. 

“Thanks.” I replied. 

I walked around to the driver's side of the car and opened the door. 

“Oh  and one more thing!” He said. 

I looked at him. 

“Watch out.” He said. 

I didn’t reply. 

I blasted my music as I drove to Jack’s house  hoping it would drown out my anxiety. It didn’t. 

I parked my car in the stone driveway and stayed inside the car  admiring the house. 

It was a *huge* house; with stone pillars on the front porch  and the greenest grass I had ever seen in my life. I turned the car off and got out. I grabbed the package  and walked to the front door  getting the key from where he said it would be. 

I opened the door and stepped in  closing it behind me. 

I thought about what he had said  about locking the door when I got inside. I thought that was a little overboard  but as I stared at the closed door something made me reach out and lock it. 

I walked inside  my feet cushioned by the thick maroon carpet  and admired the inside of the house. All the furniture was wooden and looked incredibly expensive. I would probably finish school a dozen times with the money that it took to furnish this place. 

I set the package down on the coffee table  and as I walked back to the door  I heard a phone ringing from somewhere inside the house. I froze. 

In my pocket  my phone buzzed. I took it out to look. 

**Don’t answer any calls that aren’t from Marvin.** 

I put my phone back and followed the sound of the phone  poking my head into a few different rooms before I found it in an office. 

I walked over to the desk and looked at the caller ID. 

*Incoming call from Jack.* 

That was odd. 

I grabbed my phone to look at the message again. I was starting to get a little bit creeped out and decided I wouldn’t answer  just to be safe  and left the house  remembering to lock the door as I left. 

I’ve done a few more favors for Jack since then. I drove a BMW to a random park in another city  only to get out and drive a different car back to Jack’s house. He had me meet one of his “employees” at lunch  who then gave me a briefcase to deliver to the first house I had gone to and told me he would know if I looked inside. On several occasions  he asked me to drive down to that same house and stay with the guy  whose name was Julio  for a certain amount of time.

In total  I’ve made around $3500. 

Most recently  Jack asked me to stay in his house overnight. I woke up to a text message from him. 

**I need you to spend the night at my house.** 

I hadn’t ever seen him in person  but I had talked to him on the phone a few times. He proceeded to tell me he would pay me $1000 to spend the night at his house  provided that I followed a few rules. 

I drove to his house that evening. The driveway was empty  and it normally was  but the porch light was on. I walked up  unlocked the door  went inside and then locked it again. 

Everything in the house looked the same. Jack had told me over the phone that he would leave the list of rules on the dining room table. I set all my stuff down in the living room. My bags looked like garbage compared to the fancy furniture in there. 

I wandered into the kitchen  and then to the dining room. Sure enough  there was a piece of paper on the wooden table  held down by an empty glass. 

*Lock the door when you come in.* 

*Only answer calls from Marvin.* 

*Don’t turn on any faucets between 9 pm and 11 pm.* 

*Don’t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* 

*If the door to the closet at the end of the hall is open  sleep in the library. If closed  sleep in any of the bedrooms.* 

*The gardener comes at midnight. If he starts knocking on the windows  hide.* 

*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* 

*Help yourself to anything in the fridge. :)*

*I’ll pay you in the morning. Goodnight!*

I made sure to follow all the rules. To be honest  I was regretting my decision. But  seeing as I was already here  and I was getting paid  I decided to stay anyway. I figured as long as I followed all the rules  I’d be perfectly fine. 

Still  it felt a little odd. What was this? A haunted house?

Nevertheless  I lounged around the house for a few hours  as I was planning on going to sleep around nine since that’s the time that all the weird shit would begin to happen. At 8:50  I brushed my teeth  using the faucet for the last time before 9. 

I checked the closet in the hallway and upon seeing that it was open  I moved my stuff into the library and got ready to sleep on the couch. I locked to doors just in case  and laid on the couch  scrolling through my phone. I hadn’t gotten any more messages from Jack  and I started to think up scenarios and reasons as to why he had such strict  peculiar sets of rules in his house. 

I had dozed off at some point because  at exactly 10:16 pm  I was woken up by the doorbell ringing. I was about to get up to check  but then I remembered the rule. 

*Don’t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* 

I stayed on the couch  trying not to move  paranoid that they would hear even the slightest sound. 

“It’s the police! Open up.” 

I didn’t move. 

“Hello? It’s the police! Open up or we’re coming in.”

I still didn’t move  but I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. 

There was silence for a while after that. 

Then the doorbell rang again. 

“Hey  it’s Jack! Let me in!”

It sounded like Jack  but still  I didn’t get up. He would have a key  wouldn’t he? Why would he need me to let him in?

This continued for almost a full hour; different people would ring the doorbell  announce themselves  and then disappear when I didn’t respond. 

I was finally able to fall asleep  and the gardener never came. 

When I woke up the next morning  I heard someone in the kitchen. I got up slowly  and unlocked the door as quietly as possible  taking my phone with me and walking across the living room and into the kitchen. 

I stopped at the entrance and peered in. 

It was Jack. He was standing in front of the stove  stirring something as the coffee machine brewed coffee on the counter behind him. 

“Hey! Good morning!” He said when he saw me. 

“Hi.” I replied  nervous. 

I hadn’t seen him in person before  but he looked exactly like his pictures online. 

“Scrambled eggs?” He asked  motioning to the pan with a wooden spoon. 

“Yeah  thanks!” I replied  walking over to take the plate from him. 

I ate my breakfast and drank some coffee in silence. 

“So how was it?” He asked. 

“It was okay. Nothing super freaky happened.” I replied. 

“Cool!” He replied.

There was an awkwardness in the room. 

“I think I’m gonna go now. I have class…” I trailed off. 

I didn't. But I really wanted to get out of there. 

“Oh  no! Yeah  sure! I’ll talk to you some other time.” He replied. 

I grabbed my stuff and he walked me to my car. I could see him standing in the driveway  staring at me as I left. 

When I got home  I unpacked all my stuff and noticed that I still had the list with me. I sat on my bed and read it again. I felt my body tense up as I realized that I had forgotten something. 

*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* 

*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* 

*DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* 

I stared at the words on the page until they lost meaning. 

Beside me  my phone buzzed  snapping me back to reality. 

It was the $1000 payment. 

I looked at my phone and then back at the list. 

Maybe it wasn’t an important step?

As I was thinking this over  a text from Jack came it. 

**I’m not in town right now  I should be back next week  so you’re free from running any more errands for me until then! Just sent the payment  go do something fun ;)**

I stared at the message and read it again. 

And again. 

And once more for good measure. 

**I’m not in town right now.** 

I thought back to this morning  and how Jack was in his house. How he gave me breakfast. 

**I’m not in town right now.** 

Within minutes  a new text came in this time from a number that I didn’t recognize. 

**Did you forget to do something? ;)**

The text was followed by a picture of Jack - or  whoever this version of Jack was- standing in front of the tv. 

I didn’t respond. 

Next came another picture  this one was of the outside of my house. 

It was followed by another text.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,Something walks whistling past my house every night at 3:03.,"Every night  no matter the weather  something walks down our street whistling softly. You can only hear it if you’re in the living room or the kitchen when they walk by and it always starts at exactly 3:03. The sound starts faint  somewhere near the beginning of the lane near the Carson place. We’re towards the middle of the street  so the whistling moves past us before fading away in the direction of the cul de sac.

When I was younger  my sister and I would sneak into the kitchen some nights to listen. Mom and dad didn’t like that and we’d catch Hell if they found us out there but they were never too hard on us since we always stuck to the one Big Rule.

Don’t try to look at whatever was whistling.

My neighborhood is a funny place. I’ve lived here since I was six and I love it. The houses are small but well-kept  good-sized yards  plenty of places to roam. There are a lot of other kids here my age  I turned 13 back in October. We grew up together and would always play four square in the cul de sac or roam around from back porch to back porch in the summer. This was a good place to grow up  I’m old enough to see it. And there’s only the two strange things here; the night whistling and the good luck.

The whistling never bothered me much. Like I said  I couldn’t even hear it from my bedroom. But mom and dad don’t like talking about it  so I’ve stopped asking questions. My dad is a strong guy  tall and calm. He has an accent since he moved to the US as a kid. His family  my grandparents  they’re from the islands. That’s what they call it. My dad  the only time he isn’t so calm is if the whistler comes up.

He talks a little quicker then  eyes move faster  and he tells us not to think about it so much and to always remember the one rule  the Big Rule: don’t try to look outside when the whistler goes past.

Not that we could look even if we wanted. See  there are shutters on the inside of every window  thick pieces of heavy canvas that pull down from the top and latch to the bottom of the window frame. Each latch even has a small lock  about the size of what you’d find on a diary. My dad locks those shutters every night before we all go to bed and keeps the key in his room.

My mom…I don’t know what she thinks about the whistling. I’ve seen her out in the living room before at 3:03 when the sound starts; I could see her if I cracked my door open just an inch to peek. She’s not out there often  at least I haven’t caught her much  but once or twice a month I think she sits out there on our big red couch just listening.

The whistler has the same tune every night. It’s…cheerful.

*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*

Remember how I said there are two odd things about where I live? Well  besides our night whistler  everyone in my neighborhood is really lucky. It’s hard to explain and dad doesn’t like us talking about this part much  either  but good things just seem to happen to people around here a lot. Usually  it’s small things  winning a radio contest  or getting an unexpected promotion at work  or finding some arrowheads buried in the yard  you know  the authentic kind.

The weather is pretty good and there’s no crime and everybody’s gardens bloom extra bright in the fall. “A million little blessings ” I’ve heard my mom say about living here. But the main reason we stay here  why we moved here in the first place  is my sister Nola. She was born very sick  something with her lungs. We couldn’t even bring her home when she was born  only visit her in the hospital. She was so small  I remember  small even compared to the other babies. A machine had to breathe for her.

We moved into our house here to be closer to the hospital. As soon as we moved here  Nola starting getting better. The doctors couldn’t figure it out  they chalked it up to whatever they were doing but we all could tell they were confused. But my parents knew  even I knew  Nola getting better was just another of the million little blessings we got for living in our neighborhood.

So that’s why we stayed even after we found out that  for every small miracle that happens here every day  now and then…some bad things happen. But they only happen if you look for the whistler.

See  our neighborhood has a Welcoming Committee. They show up with macaroni casserole and a gift basket and a manila folder whenever someone new moves in. They’re very friendly. Four people showed up when we moved in seven years ago. The committee made small talk  gave me a Snickers bar  and took turns holding Nola. It was her first week out of the hospital so they were extra careful.

Then the committee asked to speak to my parents in private so I was sent to my room where I still managed to hear nearly every word. The Welcoming Committee told my parents about how nice the neighborhood was  really exceptionally  hard-to-explain kind of nice. And then they told my parents about the even harder-to-explain whistling that happened every morning at 3:03 and ended at the tick of 3:05. The group  our new neighbors  warned my parents that the whistling was quiet  would never harm or hurt us  as long as we didn’t look for what was making the sound.

This part they stressed and I pushed my ear into the door straining to hear them. People who went looking for the whistler had their luck change  sometimes tragically. A black cloud would hang over anyone that looked. Anything that could go wrong  would. The manila envelope the committee brought over contained newspaper clippings  stories about car crashes and ruined lives  public deaths and freak accidents.

“Not everyone dies ” I heard the head of the committee tell my dad. “But the life goes out of ‘em. Even if they live  there’s no light in them ever again  no presence.”

My mom  I could tell she wasn’t taking it seriously. She kept asking if this was some prank they play on new neighbors. At one point my mom got angry  accused the committee of trying to scare us out of our new home  asked them if they were racist on account of my dad being from the islands. My dad calmed her down  told her he could tell our new neighbors were sincere and they were just trying to help us. He explained that he grew up hearing these kinds of stories from his mom and that he knew there were strange things that walked among us. Some of those strange things were good and some were bad but most were just different.

After the committee left  dad went out to the hardware store  bought the canvas blinds  the latches  and the locks and installed them on every window in the house after dinner. That first night in our new house  I crept out of my room at 3 a.m. only to find my dad awake sitting on the living room couch  holding my baby sister. My dad held up his finger in a shh motion but patted the couch next to him. I sat and we waited.

At exactly 3:03 we heard the whistling.

*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*

It came and it went just like our neighbors said. The whistling returns each night and we never look and we enjoy our million little blessings every day. Nola breathes on her own and she’s grown into a strong  clever girl. My dad even joined the Welcoming Committee. We don’t get new neighbors often  why would anyone want to leave? But when a new family moves in  my dad and the committee bring them macaroni casserole  a gift basket  and the manila folder. I can always tell by the look on my dad’s face when he comes back if the family took the committee seriously or if we’d be getting new neighbors again very soon.

Not long ago a family moved in directly next to us. The previous owner  Ms. Maddie  passed away at age 105. She’d lived a good  long life. Our new neighbors seemed like they’d fit in just fine. They believed the Welcoming Committee  took my dad’s advice about the locking shutters since they had a young child of their own. Whatever newspaper clippings were in that manila envelope  whatever evidence  my dad never let us see. But I imagine it must have been awfully convincing since our neighbors got along with no issues for the first month.

One night  when our new neighbors had to leave town  they sent their son  Holden  to stay with us. He was 12  a year under me in school. I didn’t know him well before that night but as soon as his parents dropped him off after dinner I could tell it was going to be a bad time.

“Do you know who is always out there whistling every night?” Holden asked the moment the adults left the room.

The three of us were sitting in the den  some Disney movie playing idly on the television.

My sister and I exchanged a glance. “We don’t talk about that ” I said.

“I think it’s that weirdo that lives in the big yellow house on the corner ” Holden said.

“Mr. Toles?” my sister asked. “No way  he’s really nice.”

Holden shrugged. “Must be a psycho killer  then.”

Nola tensed.

“We don’t talk about it ” I repeated. “Let’s go in my room and play Nintendo.”

We spent the next few hours playing games  eating popcorn and then watching movies. A typical sleepover but I could see Holden was getting antsy.

After my parents had wished us a good night  locked the blinds  and gone to bed  Holden stood up from his bean bag and walked over to where Nola and I were sitting on my bed.

“Have you ever even tried looking?” he asked. “It’s nearly time.”

Like most sleepovers  we’d conveniently ignored any suggestion of a bedtime. I was shocked to see he was right; it was almost 3 a.m.

I sighed. “We don’t-”

“See  I can’t  I can’t even try to look because my dad locks the blinds every night and hides the key ” he continued  ignoring me.

“So does our dad ” said Nola.

“No ” replied Holden. “No  he doesn’t.”

“You saw him do it ” I said  a little sharper than I meant to sound.

Holden grinned. “Your dad locks the blinds  yeah  but he doesn’t hide the key. He keeps it right on his normal key chain.”

“So?” I asked  worried I already knew what he would say next. Because I had noticed that my dad didn’t bother hiding the key anymore after all of these years. Because he knew we took it seriously.

“So  after your dad locked up but before your parents went to bed  I went to the bathroom. And on my way  I may have peeked into their room  and I may have seen your dad’s key chain on his nightstand  and I maybe went and borrowed the key to blinds.”

Nola and I stared and his grin only grew wider.

“You’re lying ” I said.

Holden shrugged. “You can check if you want. Just open your parents’ door and look  you’ll see his keychain right there on the nightstand.”

“Stay here ” I told both of them. “Don’t move a muscle.”

I hurried over to my parents’ room but hesitated at the door. If Holden wasn’t lying…my dad would be angry. Beyond angry. I was scared thinking about it. But more scared of an open window with the whistler right outside. I opened the door  barely an inch  and looked in but it was too dark to see. Taking a deep breath  I walked into the room.

Two steps into the dark I froze. The whistling started. And I could hear it clearly…from my parents’ room. I never realized but they must have heard the sound every night since we moved into the house. They never told us. I don’t think I could have slept through it.

I stood there  listening to the whistling come closer  unsure whether I should turn on a light or call out for my dad. Soft sounds from the living room brought me back to reality.

“Nola ” I yelled  running out of my parents’ room.

Holden and Nola were standing near the front door next to a window. Holden wasn’t lying. I could see him fumbling with the lock on one of the blinds. I heard a click. He did have the key.

Holden let out a quick laugh. Nola stood next to him  hunched up  afraid but maybe curious. The whistling was right outside our house now.

I think I made a sound  called out. I can’t remember. Time felt frozen  clock hands nailed to the face. But I found myself moving. I’m not fast  I’ve never been athletic. Somehow  though  I covered the space between myself and Nola in a moment. My eyes were locked on her but I heard Holden pull the blind all the way down so it could release. I heard the snap of it start to raise  and I heard the whistling just on the other side of the window.

But I had my arms around Nola and I turned us so she was facing away from the window. At the same time  I jammed my eyes shut.  The blind whipped open.

The whistling stopped.

I felt Nola shaking in my arms.

“Don’t look  okay?” I told her. “Don’t turn around.”

We were positioned so that she was facing back towards the hallway and I was facing the window. My eyes were still closed. I felt her nod into my shoulder.

I reached out with the arm not holding Nola and tried to touch Holden. My hand brushed against his arm. He was shaking worse than Nola.

“Holden?” I asked.

Silence.

I reached past him and gingerly felt for the window  eyes still sealed shut. The glass was cold against my fingertips. Colder than it should have been for the time of year. I moved my hand up the window  searching for the string to the blind. The glass began to get warmer the further I reached and there was a gentle hum feeding back into my fingertips. I tried not to think about what might be on the other side of the window. Finally  I touched the string and yanked the blinds shut.

I opened my eyes. In the dim light leaking out from the kitchen  I could make out Holden  pale and small  staring at the now closed window.

“Holden?” I asked again.

He turned towards me and he *screamed.*

Everything became a flurry of motion. Lights sparked to life in the hall  then the living room. My parents’ footsteps thudded across the hardwood floor. I didn’t turn to look back at them  my eyes were glued to Holden.

He was pale  had bit his lip so hard there was a thin red line of blood running down his chin and he’d wet himself.

“What happened?” my dad asked from behind me.

I managed to swivel away from Holden and look back. “He looked.”

I’d never seen my dad scared before but I saw it that night  in that moment  an old  ugly terror stitched on his face. A parent’s fear.

“Just Holden?” he mouthed to me.

I nodded yes.

My dad let out a breath. He looked so relieved I nearly expected him to cheer. But then he turned to Holden and my dad’s face changed. I wondered if he felt bad for feeling good that Holden was the only one that looked.

There was a knock at the door.

We all froze. Holden whimpered.

“Don’t answer it ” my mom said.

She stood at the threshold of the hall. I’d always thought she was a skeptic and just humored my dad about the windows and the whistler but that night we were all believers. I noticed that both of my parents held baseball bats they must have taken from their bedroom.

The knock came again  a little louder this time.

“Please don’t open the door ” Holden whispered.

My dad walked over to him  hugged him close.

“We won’t ” my dad promised  still holding his bat. “Nothing is coming in here tonight.”

Thud thud thud

This time the knocking was loud enough to rattle the door. Holden screamed again and Nola clutched her arms around my neck. My mom came over and knelt down next to us  wrapping my sister and me close.

**Thud thud thud**

“Call the police ” my mom whispered to my dad.

The knocking instantly stopped. My dad looked over his shoulder at us.

“Do you think-”

He was cut off by frantic knocking that trailed off to a polite tap tap tap.

“*Police* ” something said from the other side of the door.

The voice from outside sounded exactly like my mom  like a parrot repeating the words back to her.

“*Police*. *Call*. *The police*.” **tap tap tap** “*Police*.”

My mom pulled us closer.

“*Police*. *Police*. *Police*. *Police*.”

“Please stop ” I heard her whisper.

“I don’t think calling them will help ” my dad said. “How will we know when they’re the ones at the door?”

The knocking came back harder than before. The door shook. Then it stopped. After a long moment  I heard the knocking again but it was coming from our backdoor.

We all turned together towards the backdoor but the knocking immediately returned to the front door. Front to back  back to front  loud then quiet then loud again. Suddenly  the sound was coming from both doors at once  big  heavy blows like a sledgehammer. Then something started rapping against all of the windows in the house  then the walls. It was like we were living inside a drum with a dozen people trying to play at once. Or we were a turtle and something was attempting to claw us out of our shell.

“STOP!” Holden yelled.

The knocking died.

“I won’t tell ” Holden said  staring at the door. “I promise I won’t tell anyone what I saw. Just please go away.”

We waited for nearly a minute. Then we heard it  a soft *tap tap tap* coming from the window Holden had looked through earlier.

Holden started to cry  sobbing like a prisoner watching gallows being built outside their cell.

My dad held him  brushed his hair but never lied to him  never told him things would be okay.

The tapping at the window went on for the rest of the night. We huddled together in the living room for I don’t know how long. Eventually  my mom tried to take us kids into my room while my dad stayed to watch the door. But the second we moved into my bedroom the knocking came back  so loud it was possible to ignore. I was afraid the door couldn’t take it.

We went back to the living room and the knocking stopped. Only the tap tap tap on the window remained. None of us slept that night.

The tapping stopped around 7 a.m. That’s about the time the sun comes up here. We waited another two hours before my dad opened the blinds from one window. He made us all go back to my parents’ bedroom first. I heard him open the door then come back in.

“Okay ” he told us. “It’s done.”

Holden’s parents came back around lunchtime. My mom and dad walked Holden over to his house and they all went inside for quite a while. Nola and I watched from the window. She stuck to me the whole day  right at my side  sometimes holding my hand. When my parents came back they looked grim but wouldn’t tell us what they said to Holden’s family. It was a Sunday so we all spent the day together  ordered pizza and watched movies.

That night everyone slept in my room  Nola and my mom in the bed with me  my dad in a chair he’d pulled over. There was no knocking that night or any night since.

We didn’t see much of Holden or his parents for the rest of that week but by Thursday there was a moving truck in their driveway. Nola and I watched them packing up the whole afternoon after school. What sticks with me most is how tired Holden and his parents looked. All three had the same pallor  grim mouths and light-less eyes. Even from across the street I could tell something was very wrong. Holden and his family were gone before sunset.

I remember what the original Welcoming Committee said to my parents when we moved in. Not everyone who looks at the whistler dies  but even those that live have the light go out of them and the rest of their lives are full of misfortune. A million little tragedies.

I think Holden’s parents must have looked  either to comfort him if they didn’t believe or share the burden if they did. I watch Nola some days  happy and young and alive  and I wonder if I’d been slower  if she’d looked out the window that night…would I have looked too? To comfort her? To share that burden? I’m glad I don’t have to find out.

We still live in that house  in that neighborhood. We still hear our whistler walking past every night. The blessings  the luck  the good things here are too good to leave. But we’re careful. We don’t have friends over to spend the night anymore. And my dad hides the key to the blinds very  very well. Not that I’ve gone looking. Some things you just don’t need to look for.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,She Sold Happiness in Glass Jars,"The poster read  “Happiness! Sold in Glass Jars! Call Today!” and underneath the text was a phone number.

I was walking home from a long  exhausting day of work when I caught a glimpse of the paper stapled on an old telephone pole. I took a picture of it thinking it was amusing.

I was going to show my wife once I got to our apartment  but I was caught up with chores and forgot about it—dinner  dishes  laundry  packing a snack for our daughter  putting her to bed  then putting her toys away that she’d left out in the living room—every night  it was the exact same routine.

The next day  I awoke sleeping back-to-back with my wife. I always had to get up earlier than she did for my job  so I quietly got ready for the day and headed out the door.

At work  I was updating the company’s latest expense report. Most days were similar to this one. They were basically paying me to stare at a computer for nine hours a day and input a couple numbers in to a spreadsheet. I finished my work very quickly  so I decided to head out of the office early—it also helped that it was a Friday  and a lot of people leave early at the end of the week.

On my walk back  I was thinking of what my life had become. I did this often. I always dreamed of traveling when I was younger. I wanted to drive across the country or solo-backpack across Europe. Then I met Kelsey. Don’t get me wrong  I loved Kelsey. I mean  I still do. We just don’t have that spark anymore. When you meet someone and get in a relationship  whether it’s *meant to be* or not  some of your personal life-plans have to be put on hold. And then that relationship turns to marriage  and then you have a baby  then you have to enroll your daughter in a preschool  then you have to get a better paying job and work more hours and blah  blah  blah.

I’m not trying to throw a pity party for myself. I’m just saying I wasn’t exactly content with where I was in my life. I wouldn’t have referred to myself as a happy person.

As I took the same route home that I did every day to work and back  I walked by the same poster I had passed the day before. I don’t know why  I really don’t  but I decided to call the number. I figured it would be some joke. Maybe someone just picks up and says  “I love you!” on the other end and hangs up. Or maybe it’s a line to a sex-worker. I had no idea what to expect.

I called. It only rang once before someone picked up.

“Hello?” a woman said. 

“Uh  hi—um  I’m calling about your poster? Your ad?”

“Oh  awesome ” she said calmly  “when do you wanna pick it up?”

“Pick what up?”

“The jar…” she said  like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

“Oh  of course  um ” I realized then that I had left work early without telling Kelsey  so I could just go pick it up now and she’d be none the wiser  “what exactly is it? That your selling?”

“I just told you. It’s happiness. In a glass jar. Like the poster said. Happiness keeps best in glass jars. They’re more durable than  say  a plastic bag.”

“Um  okay. Should we meet somewhere?”

“For sure. I don’t want you to end up being a creep or something  so let’s go to a public place.”

The public place we decided on was a Starbucks parking lot a little over a mile from me.

Now  I didn’t think I was really going to be buying a *jar of happiness* or whatever. I was 99% sure she was going to sell me drugs. Maybe heroine would be in the jar. I remember thinking  *Oh no  ‘happiness’ is probably a nickname for some street drug and I’m going to a drug deal. What if she’s a cop? Am I going to be arrested?* But something inside me told me to keep walking  and so I did.

I stood outside and texted her.

Me: **I’m here.**

Her: **Cool. Be there in a sec.**

Me: **What are you driving?**

Her: **Silver Camry.**

And as her final text came through  I saw her car pull in. She took a spot not too far from where I stood. I could see there was no one else in the car  which put my kidnapping fear to rest. She opened her door and stood on the pavement  looking around until her eyes met mine. I gave her a little nod of acknowledgment. She simply responded by waving her hand  gesturing for me to come over to her car  so I did.

She was young  maybe mid-twenties  with curly  golden hair. Her skin was pale and contrasted with the all-black outfit she was wearing. I thought she looked like Glinda the Good Witch from *The Wizard of Oz* had put on the Wicked Witch’s clothes.

“Nice day out ” she said as a greeting.

“Oh  yeah it is. Hadn’t really paid attention to it.”

“You *were* the one that called about the jar  right?”

“Yeah  that was me.”

“Cool  well  here you go.”

She handed me a very small  glass mason-jar. It couldn’t have been more than two inches tall. Inside of it was a light. Not a light bulb—just light. It was like someone bottled up sunshine. It glowed even in the midafternoon daylight. It looked like a tiny sun  or a tiny universe existing in this little crystal-walled home. I was admiring it with no attempt to hide the awe on my face.

“Pretty rad isn’t it?”

“What—what is it?”

“You’ve asked that  like  three different times  I think. My answer is still the same. It is happiness. Happiness in a glass jar.”

“What do I do with it?”

“Keep it ” She said simply  “if you have any problems shoot me a text.”

She started to get into her car.

“Wait!” I said  “I thought you were selling this? How much is it?”

“Don’t worry  man ” she said with a smile  “you’ll pay.”

She closed her door and I stepped out of her way as she backed up  then drove off. What the hell had just happened? What was I holding? I looked down at the jar again  its radiance was simply mesmerizing. I put it in my pocket and could see its glow slightly through my pants. I began to walk home.

What was just a nice  sunny day  quickly changed into a rainy one with clouds wrapping the sky. It was not forecasted that it would rain  or else I would’ve ridden the bus or subway to work that day. I jogged home trying not to get too drenched. I finally found shelter once I made it to my apartment building.

I walked up to my door and found that my key wasn’t on my key ring anymore. *Shit  I can’t believe I lost it again * I thought.

I knocked on the door and said in a somewhat loud voice  “Hey babe it’s me  I don’t know what happened to my key.” I heard the door being unlocked from the other side.

When the door opened  I was greeted by a large  heavy-set man with greasy hair and unkempt goatee  he said  “I think you got the wrong door  bud.”

“Oh!” I said  disoriented  “my bad  sorry  have a good one.”

He let out a chuckle as he closed the door. 

Apartment number 33.

I know that was my apartment. I know it was. I’d been in apartment 33 for five years now. But *that* was not my apartment. From what I could see inside  all the furniture was different  it was painted a different color  it was all wrong. I felt like I’d hit my head and was drugged. In that moment  nothing made sense.

I pulled out my phone to call Kelsey so she could calm me down and tell me I just got confused for a second. But her contact wasn’t in my phone. In fact  nothing was in my phone. I had no messages with her. No previous calls. No pictures. It was like my phone reset to its factory settings. Did that girl somehow switch my phone out when I wasn’t looking? I would’ve just dialed Kelsey's number manually  but I couldn’t quite remember it. I had known it by heart before  but not anymore. I needed to get back to the office  I had all my contacts backed up on my work computer.

Since it was still raining  I hopped on the bus which had a stop right in front of the apartment complex. I rode downtown toward my office  the whole time staring at my wet shoes  wondering what the hell was going on.

We have a keycard access to our building so only authorized personnel can get inside. I always keep my access card in my wallet  always. But  surprise  surprise—it wasn’t there. I buzzed in to the speaker we had for guests with appointments  or employees as a back-up in case anyone lost or forgot their card. 

**BZZZ** 

“Hey this is Tim  I must’ve lost my card. My employee number is…” I stopped as I drew a blank.

A voice came through the Speaker  “Tim? You got cut out  what’s your employee number?""

“Um  I can’t remember  I—”

“That’s fine  just tell me your full name and department.”

“Uh  finance. I’m in finance. My full name is Tim Brooks.”

“One sec.”

About thirty seconds later  the man spoke to me again.

“We don’t have a Tim Brooks working in this building. Did you have an appointment with someone?”

I backed up in surprise  almost tripping on my own feet. I had just been in that office an hour or two ago. What was happening to me? I felt like I was getting Alzheimer’s but going through every stage in one day. I stared at my hands  unsure if I was in the right body. I felt like the world around me was disintegrating. I wasn’t in control  I was merely sitting inside somebody else’s head  watching the world through their eyes.

Just then  I got a text. I recognized the number immediately  it was that girl. The one who gave me the jar. I had forgotten all about it until I saw her text.

Her: **Hey. How’s it going?**

I looked at my phone  dumbfounded. It made me angry she was so nonchalant about this. *She* knew what was going on. *She* had done this somehow.

Me: **What the hell did you do to me?!**

Her: **The worst is yet to come.**

I was astronomically close to just chucking my phone as far as I could in frustration. I took the jar out of my pocket. It looked unchanged  still glowing just as bright.

“What the fuck did you do!” I yelled at the jar  realizing I probably looked like a lunatic.

As I stared at its glistening glass  I realized something. I didn’t know what my wife’s face looked like anymore. I knew her name. Well  I know it started with a K  or maybe a C. I couldn’t picture her in my mind. I knew I had a wife. I knew I did. Yes  because I had a daughter. I had a wife and a daughter. I just  couldn’t remember their faces then—or their names  or their birthdays  or any memories I had with them.

I know they existed. They did exist. I had just seen them that morning  right? I couldn’t remember how she looked  or what she smelled like. What was our first date? We had a wedding  right? What about our first kiss? Or my daughter—or was it my son? Maybe I didn’t even have a kid. But my wife  or girlfriend  she was real. I knew she was. The thought was tearing me apart. I couldn’t see her in my head. I couldn’t recall a single fact about her.

I was standing outside of the same building  but I was unsure why I was. Did I work there? I must work somewhere. The rain was accompanied by a chilly wind now. It was whipping at my face  making my nose and cheeks sting. I wanted to go home. I wanted to be with her. I wanted to be warm. I wanted to go in to a shitty office job that kept a roof over my head. I wanted it all. I was soaking wet. I was miserable. I couldn’t remember my parents  or my childhood. Did I even have any friends? Why was I in the rain?

I looked down at my hand. I was still clutching the jar. The only memory of my entire life I could concretely remember was that girl giving it to me. Telling me it was happiness. It did not bring happiness. It brought pain. It bought suffering. I was more miserable in that moment than I’d ever been.

My phone buzzed:

**Break the jar  Tim.**

I looked at my other hand. With the setting sun and the rainy sky  I swear the jar glowed brighter than any street light near me. I didn’t break it because I was following her instruction. I broke it because I was angry. I broke it because I was upset. I needed a release. I raised my arm above my head  and brought it down with one swift motion  shattering the jar on the concrete beneath my feet.

That dark  chilly air accompanying the rain spread away like it was the shockwave of a bomb going off  and I was at the epicenter. I saw the warm  yellow light from inside the jar spread rapidly across the ground and ascend into the sky. It was as if I was watching the beginnings of the universe being created—like God had just snapped his fingers and said  “let there be light.” I was engulfed in it. I could no longer see street or rain  or anything dark. I felt like I was plummeting into a star going faster than the speed of light. It felt like sitting in front of a fire on a cold winter’s night  but that warmth was covering every inch by body.

And then I blinked.

Immediately I could feel the sheets beneath me  and my back barely touching my wife’s. I was staring out the window. The morning light drenched through the glass and gleamed on my face.

I stood from bed and grabbed my phone. It was Friday morning. I had one text:

**Let me know if you ever need another jar :)**

I called in sick to work. I snuck into my daughter’s room and greeted her with a kiss and told her she didn’t have to go to preschool today. We were going to have a family day. She smiled and stretched out her arms with a yawn before curling up and falling back asleep. 

I got back in bed and squeezed my wife tightly. I didn’t let go for hours. Our daughter came into our room and woke us up eventually—she was jumping on the bed and shouting for us to wake up. Yesterday I may have found that annoying. Yesterday I may have found a lot of things annoying  or monotonous  or dull.

But not today. Today  I pulled her under the covers in between me and Kelsey.

Today was going to be a good day. Today  I was happy.",flard,03-25-2019,False,1560805163.0,False,False,False,526,31,23,,26923,0
/r/nosleep/,nosleep,A Shattered Life,"I don't know when you're going to read this  but I can tell you when it started: I was out for a walk alone in the woods when the entity came for me. It was beyond a blur. It was  for lack of a better term  absence of meaning. Where it hid  there were no trees; where it crept closer  there was no grass; through the arc it leapt at me  there was no breeze of motion. There was no air at all.

As it struck  I felt the distinct sensation of claws puncturing me somewhere unseen; somewhere I'd never felt before. My hands and arms and legs and torso seemed fine and I wasn't bleeding  but I knew I'd been injured somehow. As I fearfully ran back home  I could tell that I was less. I was vaguely tired  and it was hard to focus at times.

The solution at that early stage was easy: a big cup of coffee helped me feel normal again.

For a while  that subtle drain on my spirit became lost in the ebb and flow of caffeine in my system. You could say my life began that week  actually  because that was when I met Mar. She and I got along great  though  to be honest  I'm pretty sure I fell in love with her over the phone before we even met.

It was almost as if the strong emotions of that first week made the entity fight back—it was still with me  latched on to some invisible part of my being.

The first few incidents were minor  and I hardly worried about them. The color of a neighbor's car changed from dark blue to black one morning  and I stared at it before shaking my head and shrugging off the difference. Two days later  at work  a coworker's name changed from Fred to Dan. I carefully asked around  but everyone said his name had always been Dan. I figured I'd just been mistaken.

Then  as ridiculous as this sounds  I was peeing in my bathroom at home when I suddenly found myself on a random street. I was still in my pajamas  pants down  and urinating—but now in full view of a dozen people at a bus stop. Horrified  I pulled up my clothes and ran before someone called the cops. I did manage to get home  but the experience forced me to admit that I was still in danger. The entity was doing something to me  and I didn't understand how to fight back.

Mar showed up that evening  but she had her own key.

""Hey "" I asked her with confusion. ""How'd you get a key?""

She just laughed. ""You're cute. Are you sure you're okay with this?"" She opened a door and entered a room full of boxes. ""I know living together is a big step  especially when we've only been dating three months.""

Living together? I'd literally just met her the week before. Thing was  my mother had always called me a smart cookie for a reason. I knew when to shut my yap. Instead of causing a scene  I told her everything was fine—and then I went straight to my room and began investigating.

My things were just as I had left them with no sign of a three month gap in habitation  but I did find something out of the ordinary: the date. I shivered angrily as I processed the truth.

The entity had eaten three months of my life.

What the hell was I facing? What kind of creature could consume pieces of one's soul like that? I'd missed the most exciting part of a new relationship  and I would never understand any shared stories or in-jokes from that period. Something absurdly precious had been taken from me  and I was furious.

That fury helped suppress the entity. I never imbibed alcohol. I drank coffee religiously. I checked the date every time I woke up. For three years  I managed to live each day while observing nothing more than minor alterations. A social fact here and there—someone's job  how many kids they had  that sort of thing—the layout of nearby streets  the time my favorite television show aired  that kind of thing. Always  those changes reminded me the creature still had its claws sunk into my spirit. Not once in three years did I ever let myself zone out.

One day  I grew careless. I let myself get really into the season finale of my favorite show. It was gripping; a fantastic story. Right at the height of the action  a young boy came up to my lounger and shook my arm.

Surprised  I asked  ""Who are you? How did you get in here?""

He laughed and smiled brightly. ""Silly Daddy!""

My heart sank in my chest. I knew immediately what had happened. After a few masked questions  I discovered that he was two years old—and that he was my son.

The agony and heartache filling my chest was nearly unbearable. Not only had I missed the birth of my son  I would never see or know the first years of his life. Mar and I had obviously gotten married and started a family in the time I'd lost  and I had no idea what joys or pains those years contained.

It was snowing outside. Holding my sudden son in my lap  I sat and watched the flakes fall outside. What kind of life was this going to be if slips in concentration could cost me years? I had to get help.

The church had no idea what to do. The priests didn't believe me  and told me I had a health issue rather than some sort of possession.

The doctors didn't have any clue. Nothing showed up on all their scans and tests  but they happily took my money in return for nothing.

By the time I ran out of options  I'd decided to tell Mar. There was no way to know what this all looked like from her side. What was I like when I wasn't there? Did I still take our son to school? Did I still do my job? Clearly  I did  because she seemed to be none the wiser  but I still had a horrible feeling that something must have been missing in her life when I wasn't actually home inside my own head.

But the night I set up a nice dinner in preparation  she arrived not by unlocking the front door  but by knocking on it. I answered  and found that she was in a nice dress.

She was happily surprised by the settings on the table. ""A fancy dinner for a second date? I knew you were sweet on me!""

Thank the Lord I knew when to keep my mouth shut. If I'd gone on about being married and having a son  she might have run for the hills. Instead  I took her coat and sat down for our second date.

Through carefully crafted questions  I managed to deduce the truth. This really was our second date. She saw relief and happiness in me  but interpreted that as dating jitters. I was just excited to realize that the entity wasn't necessarily eating whole portions of my life. The symptoms  as I was beginning to understand them  were more like the consequences of a shattered soul. The creature had wounded me; broken me into pieces. Perhaps I was to live my life out of order  but at least I would actually get to live it. 

And so it went for a few years—from my perspective. While minor changes in politics or geography would happen daily  major shifts in my mental location only happened every couple months. When I found myself in a new place and time in my life  I just shut up and listened  making sure to get the lay of the land before doing anything to avoid making mistakes. On the farthest-flung leap yet  I met my six-year-old grandson  and I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He said  ""Writer."" I told him that was a fine idea.

Then  I was back in month two of my relationship with Mar  and I had the best night with her on the riverfront. When I say the best  I mean *the best*. Knowing how special she would become to me  I asked her to move in. I got to live through what I'd missed the first go-around  and I came to understand that I was never mentally absent. I would always be there—eventually. When we were moving her boxes in  she stopped for a moment and said she marveled at my great love  as if I'd known her for a lifetime and never once doubted she was the one.

That was the first time I'd truly laughed freely and wholeheartedly since the entity had wounded me. She was right about my love for her  but for exactly the reason she'd considered a silly romantic analogy. I *had* known her my whole life  and I'd come to terms with my situation and found peace with it. It wasn't so bad to have sneak peeks at all the best parts ahead.

But of course I wouldn't be writing this if it hadn't gotten worse. The entity was still with me. It had not wounded me and departed like I'd wanted to believe. The closest I can describe my growing understanding was that the creature was burrowing deeper into my psyche  fracturing it into smaller pieces. Instead of months between major shifts  I began having only weeks. Once I noticed that trend  I feared my ultimate fate would be to jump between times in my life heartbeat by heartbeat  forever confused  forever lost. Only an instant in each time meant I would never be able to speak with anyone else  never be able to hold a conversation  never express or receive love.

As the true depth of that fear came upon me  I sat in an older version of me and watched the snow falling outside. That was the one constant in my life: the weather didn't care who I was or what pains I had to face. Nature was always there. The falling snow was always like a little hook that kept me in a place; the pure emotional peace it brought was like a panacea on my mental wounds  and I'd never yet shifted while watching the pattern of falling white and thinking of the times I'd gone sledding or built a snow fort as a child.

A teenager touched my arm. ""Grandpa?""

""Eh?"" He'd startled me out of my thoughts  so I was less careful than usual. ""Who are you?""

He half-grinned  as if not sure whether I was joking. Handing me a stack of papers  he said  ""It's my first attempt at a novel. Would you read it and tell me what you think?""

Ahh  of course. ""Pursuing that dream of being a writer  I see.""

He burned bright red. ""Trying to  anyway.""

""All right. Run off  I'll read this right now."" The words were blurry  and  annoyed  I looked for glasses I probably had for reading. Being old was *terrible*  and I wanted to leap back into a younger year—but not before I read his book. I found my glasses in a sweater pocket  and began leafing through. Mar puttered in and out of the living room  still beautiful  but I had to focus. I didn't know how much time I would have there.

It seemed that we had relatives over. Was it Christmas? A pair of adults and a couple kids I didn't recognize tromped through the hallway  and I saw my son  now adult  walk by with his wife on the way out the door. As a group  the extended family began sledding outside.

Finally  I finished reading the story  and I called out for my grandson. He rushed down the stairs and into the living room. ""How was it?""

""Well  it's terrible "" I told him truthfully. ""But it's terrible for all the right reasons. You're still a young man  so your characters behave like young people  but the structure of the story itself is very solid."" I paused. ""I didn't expect it to turn out to be a horror story.""

He nodded. ""It's a reflection of the times. Expectations for the future are dismal  not hopeful like they used to be.""

""You're far too young to be aware like that "" I told him. An idea occurred to me. ""If you're into horror  do you know anything about strange creatures?""

""Sure. I read everything I can. I love it.""

Warily  I scanned the entrances to the living room. Everyone was busy outside. For the first time  I opened up to someone in my life about what I was experiencing. In hushed tones  I told him about my fragmented consciousness.

For a teenager  he took it well. ""You're serious?""

""Yes.""

He donned the determined look of a grown man accepting a quest. ""I'll look into it  see what I can find out. You should start writing down everything you experience. Build some data. Maybe we can map your psychic wound.""

Wow. ""Sounds like a plan."" I was surprised. That made sense  and I hadn't expected him to have a serious response. ""But how will I get all the notes in one place?""

""Let's come up with somewhere for you to leave them "" he said  frowning with thought. ""Then I'll get them  and we can trace the path you're taking through your own life  see if there's a pattern.""

For the first time since the situation had gotten worse  I felt hope again. ""How about under the stairs? Nobody ever goes under there.""

""Sure."" He turned and left the living room.

I peered after him. I heard him banging around near the stairs.

Finally  he returned with a box  laid it on the carpet  and opened it to reveal a bursting stack of papers. He exclaimed  ""Holy crap!""—but of course  being a teenager  he didn't really say *crap*.

Taken aback  I blinked rapidly  forgiving his cussing because of the shock. ""Did I write those?""

He looked up at me with wonder. ""Yeah. Or  you will. You still have to write them and put them under the stairs after this."" He gazed back down at the papers—then covered the box. ""So you probably shouldn't see what they say. That could get weird.""

That much I understood. ""Right.""

He gulped. ""There are like fifty boxes under there  all filled up like this. Deciphering these will take a very long time."" His tone dropped to deadly seriousness. ""But I will save you  grandpa. Because I don't think anyone else can."" 

Tears flowed down my cheeks then  and I couldn't help but sob once or twice. I hadn't realized how lonely I'd become in my shifting prison of awareness until I finally had someone who understood. ""Thank you. Thank you so much.""

And then I was young again  and at work on a random Tuesday. Once the sadness and relief faded  anger and determination replaced them. After I finished my work  I grabbed some paper and began writing. While the weeks shifted around me  while those weeks became days  and then hours  I wrote every single spare moment about when and where I thought I was. I put them under the stairs out of order; my first box was actually the thirtieth  and my last box was the first. Once I had over fifty boxes written from my perspective—and once my shifting became a matter of minutes—I knew it was up to my grandson to take it from there.

I put my head down and stopped looking. I couldn't stand the river of changing awareness any longer. Names and places and dates and jobs and colors and people were all wrong and different.

I'd never been older. I sat watching the snow fall. A man of at least thirty that I vaguely recognized entered the room. ""Come on  I think I finally figured it out.""

I was so frail that moving was painful. ""Are you him? Are you my grandson?""

""Yes."" He took me to a room filled with strange equipment and sat me in a rubber chair facing a large mirror twice the height of a man. ""The pattern finally revealed itself.""

""How long have you worked on this?"" I asked him  aghast. ""Tell me you didn't miss your life like I'm missing mine!""

His expression was both stone cold and furiously resolute. ""It'll be worth it."" He brought two thin metal rods close to my arm and then nodded at the mirror. ""Look. This shock is carefully calibrated.""

The electric zap from his device was startling  but not painful. In the mirror  I saw a rapid arcing light-silhouette appear above my head and shoulder. The electricity moved through the creature like a wave  briefly revealing the terrible nature of what was happening to me. A bulging leech-like mouth was wrapped around the back of my head  coming down to my eyebrows and touching each ear  and its slug-like body ran over my shoulder and into my very soul.

It was a parasite.

And it was feeding on my mind.

My now-adult grandson held my hand as I took in the horror. After a moment  he asked  ""Removing it is going to hurt very badly. Are you up for this?""

Fearful  I asked  ""Is Mar here?""

His face softened. ""No. Not for a few years now.""

I could tell from his reaction what had happened  but I didn't want it to be true. ""How?""

""We have this conversation a lot "" he responded. ""Are you sure you want to know? It never makes you feel better.""

Tears brimmed in my eyes. ""Then I don't care if it hurts  or if I die. I don't want to stay in a time where she's not alive.""

He made a sympathetic noise of understanding and then returned to his machines to hook several wires  diodes  and other bits of technology to my limbs and forehead. While he did so  he talked. ""I've worked for two decades to figure this out  and I've had a ton of help from other researchers of the occult. This parasite doesn't technically exist in our plane. It's one of the lesser spawns of µ¬ßµ  and it feeds on the plexus of mind  soul  and quantum consciousness/reality. When details like names and colors of objects changed  you weren't going crazy. The web of your existence was merely losing strands as the creature ate its way through you.""

I didn't fully understand. I looked up in confusion as he placed a circlet of electronics like a crown on my head in exact line with where the parasite's mouth had ringed me. ""What's µ¬ßµ?""

He paused his work and grew pale. ""I forgot that you wouldn't know. You're lucky  believe me."" After a deep breath  he began moving again  and placed his fingers near a few switches. ""Ready? This is carefully tuned to make your nervous system extremely unappetizing to the parasite  but it's basically electro-shock therapy.""

I could still see Mar's smile. Even though she was dead  I'd just been with her moments ago. ""Do it.""

The click of a switch echoed in my ears  and I almost laughed at how mild the electricity was. It didn't feel like anything—at least at first. Then  I saw the mirror shaking  and my body within that image convulsing. Oh. No. It did hurt. Nothing had ever been more painful. It was just so excruciating that my mind hadn't been able to immediately process it. 

As my vision shook and fire burned in every nerve in my body  I could see the reflected trembling light-silhouette of the parasite on my head as it writhed in agony equal to mine. It had claws—six clawed lizard-like limbs under its leech-like body—and it cut into me in an attempt to stay latched on.

The electricity made my memories flare.

Mar's smile was foremost  lit brightly in front of a warm fire as the snow fell past the window behind her. The edges of that memory began lighting up  and I realized that my life *was* one continuous stretch of experience—it was only the awareness of it that had been fragmented by that feasting evil on my back.

I'd never managed to be there for the birth of my son. I'd jumped around it a dozen times  but never actually lived it. For the first time  I got to hold Mar's hand and be there for her.

No. *No!* That moment had shifted seamlessly into holding her hand as she lay in a hospital bed for a very different reason. Not this! God  why? It was so merciless to make me remember this. I broke down in tears as nurses rushed into the room. I didn't want to know. I didn't want to experience it. I'd seen all the good parts  but I hadn't wanted the worst part—the inevitable end that all would one day face.

It wasn't worth it. It was tainted. All that joy was given back ten thousand fold as pain.

The fire in my body and in my brain surged to sheer white torture  and I screamed.

My scream faded into a surprised shout as the machines and electricity and chair faded away. Snow was no longer falling around my life; I was out in the woods on a bright summer day.

Oh God.

I turned to see the creature approaching me. It was the same absence of meaning; the same blank on reality. It crept forward  just like before—but  this time  it hissed and turned away. I stood  astounded at being young again and freed from the parasite. My grandson had actually done it! He'd made me an unappetizing meal  so the predator of mind and soul had moved on in search of a different snack.

I returned home in a daze.

And while I was sitting there processing all that had happened  the phone rang. I looked at it in awe and sadness. I knew who it was. It was Marjorie  calling for the first time for some trivial reason she'd admit thirty years later was made up just to talk to me.

But all I could see was her lying in that hospital bed dying. It was going to end in unspeakable pain and loneliness. I would become an old man  left to sit by myself in an empty house  his soulmate gone long before him. At the end of it all  the only thing I would have left: sitting and watching the falling snow.

But now  thanks to my grandson  I would also have my memories. It would be a wild ride  no matter how it ended.

On a sudden impulse  I picked up the phone. With a smile  I asked  ""Hey  who's this?""

Even though I already knew.

Author's note: Together  my grandfather and I did set out to write the tale of his life. Unfortunately  his Alzheimer's disease progressed rapidly  and we were never able to finish. He's still alive  but I imagine that  mentally  he is in a better place than the nursing home. I like to think he's back in his younger days  living life and being happy  because the reality is much colder. It's snowing today; he loves the snow. When I visited him  he didn't recognize me  but he did smile as he sat looking out the window.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide. I’m not sure I want to live here anymore.,"
I moved in with my boyfriend yesterday. We’ve been together for 5 years now and we’re old and wise enough to settle down and finally leave our parents houses. He just turned 24 and I’m 22. He’s the love of my life. His name is Jamie and I couldn’t be happier to be living with him. 

When we decided to make the leap we spent 2 months looking at flats and houses  we couldn’t afford to buy yet so renting was our only option but the prices were astronomical. For our budget we would have been lucky to get a box room and a stove.

Jamie works for a local 24 hour fast food restaurant and I’m training to be a teacher. The early stages of training don’t pay much and I owe a lot in student loans so finances are tough. 

We had almost given up hope until we found our flat. It was nothing special  but to us it was a palace. A spacious 2 bedroom apartment with views of a city park  a balcony and local conveniences. It was in a tower block in a not so nice area  but neither of us had been wealthy growing up  we weren’t fussy. Just grateful to be together. 

The advert was sweetened by the deposit free option and open ended tenancy. The landlord was happy to sign a five year contract if we wanted. That sort of thing never happens in the city. We were told that along with no deposit we would also have no inspections  but would be liable to pay for any damage when we ended the tenancy. I’d never heard of anything quite like it.

We knew that for our budget and location we weren’t going to get any better. We snapped the place up fast  not even bothering to view it. It felt like our only chance. 

Move in day rolled around quickly and yesterday we got the keys to our first home together  it was such a strange feeling. The day was chaos  getting our stuff in and up in the lift. We were flat number 42  on the 7th floor. The items we couldn’t get in the lift had to be taken up all the stairs by the removal men. I think they were grateful we weren’t any higher but I still wish we had been able to give them a better tip. 

In the evening we settled down on our second hand sofa  given to us by a cousin of a friend and watched some tv. We smoked cigarettes on the balcony looking at the park and fell asleep on our mattress on the floor super early because we had no energy to put the bed together yet and Jamie had work at a hideous time of the morning. 

We slept soundly last night  I felt safe and happy. I don’t think that feeling is coming back any time soon and it’s all due to the note I found this morning. 

I found it in the kitchen  having a coffee  hours after Jamie had left for his early shift at work. It was in one of the cupboards that were fixed to the wall  there were a bunch of useful items from the previous tenant. Spare keys to the flat  a set of tiny keys that locked and unlocked the windows (necessary for those with kids this high up)  spare smoke alarm batteries and a folded up piece of paper. 

The note was handwritten with “New occupier of flat 42” in beautiful cursive on the blank side. I opened it up and sat down to read. I can’t really describe it to you  so I’m going to copy it out below. 

*Dear New Occupier *

*Firstly  welcome to your new home. I lived here before you for 35 years with my husband. Unfortunately he had an incident at home recently that I’d rather not discuss that claimed his life. My sister has now decided I can’t keep up with the demands of the property and has insisted that I move in with her and her husband. I was reluctant at first  but the stairs do kill me at my age and without Bernie it’s filled with sadness.*

*Anyway. When you’ve lived somewhere for as long as I have it feels like a person that you know. You understand it’s personality and what makes it tick. I thought it was probably pertinent that I impart some of that knowledge on you.*

*It’s a wonderful home  honestly  I have lived through best and worst years and leaving it behind is very emotional but if you are to survive and get the best out of it then there are some steps you need to follow.*

*1. The landlord will never bother you  he doesn’t visit  call or communicate in any way. But make sure to pay your rent in a timely fashion always. I have only dealt with him once in 35 years and let’s just say I never missed another rent day. Any repairs required you speak to the agent you rented the place with.*

*2. DO NOT use the communal lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am. Just don’t do it. This step is vital if you are to have a happy life here. It really is life or death. Don’t do it. This has cost me and many others in the building greatly and I would rather not elaborate on why you shouldn’t do this. Just please don’t do it. I cannot stress this enough.*

*3. When you hear the strange animal noises coming from flat 48 don’t question it  Mr Prentice lives there and he’s a lovely chap. Don’t be afraid to say hello to him in the corridor or on the stairs (he’s old school  so he never risks the lift) but whatever you do  don’t check on him when you hear the noises. You’ll know when you hear them.*

*4. If you ever come across a window cleaner on the balcony ignore him. He may seem like the nicest fellow you’ve ever had trying to sell you something at the door but it really is best that you don’t engage. He will go away if you ignore him. But he tries pretty hard the first few times so you’ll need some resilience. Whatever you do  don’t offer him anything. No money  no hot drink.*

*5. Don’t leave food scraps out. Bin or refrigerate them immediately. If you have small animals  it is imperative that you watch them eat and take away any leftover food immediately after they are done. This and rule 2 go hand in hand  the things forage all day and seem to really love animal feed. You don’t want them in your flat. I promise. You can leave what you want out between 1.11 and 3.33am so you may want to feed your pets then.*

*6. Don’t communicate with any neighbours who claim to come from flats 65-72. These flats suffered a fire in the late 80s that devastated the whole floor  all the residents died in their homes. The building was mostly council owned at the time and they never bothered to renovate the flats. They’ve been empty ever since but every now and again someone will knock at your door claiming to live in one of these flats and ask to borrow some sugar. They will seem entirely average but you must shut and lock the door immediately. I installed two extra security bolts to avoid these fuckers. I don’t like to swear at my age but they really are fuckers.*

*7. Simple one for you here  keep a weapon in each room. Sometimes you follow all these steps and something still slips through the net. Better to be safe than sorry.*

*8. The building has a committee that will try and get you to join. It’s one of those neighbours groups about improving living conditions for all residents. It’s a nice group and the lady who runs it - Terri from flat 26- is a fantastic neighbour. By all means get involved. But I wouldn’t recommend babysitting Terri’s 2 children. She’ll ask you  because the poor woman needs a break  but if you accept don’t say I didn’t warn you.*

*9. Stray hairless cats sometimes roam in the hallway. I know they’re supposedly a special  expensive breed  but they don’t belong to anyone. They’re mostly  harmless  but don’t pick them up. Not unless you see one of those neighbours that claims to live in 65-72. Then grab the cat and lock it inside with you. It’ll burn your skin a little but the cats are friendly and I wouldn’t want to see them hurt.*

*10. There is no way to fix the damp patch on the ceiling in the bedroom. Sometimes it will turn a deep crimson and look quite concerning  but please try not to be alarmed  it doesn’t drip  it doesn’t get any bigger and it’s been there longer than I have. The landlord won’t budge on it  according the the agents. I flagged it many times  even called the police the first night it changed colour  but it was a waste of time and it will be for you too. It’s best to ignore it.*

*11. You can trust the postman. His name is Ian Flanders and he’s been the postman since before I moved in. He has his own key to the main door and delivers post to the door every morning at 8.54. I can’t include everything here  or it would become a novel but if you have any questions Ian will help you.*

*12. Finally  the first few weeks are the worst. You’ll feel like you’ve made a mistake  I’m sure reading this you already do  but if you can get through the first few weeks it really is a lovely block to live in. Every property has it quirks and this one is a little extra special  but you can be truly happy here if you just take my advice. I wish you all the best  I really do.*

*Yours truly*  

*Mrs Prudence Hemmings*

I don’t really know what to think after reading the note. Hopefully it was some sort of joke but the agent had said the previous tenant was an elderly lady and I can’t see anyone named Prudence Hemmings attempting to play practical jokes on someone they’d never met. 

There were also parts of the note I couldn’t disprove  there was indeed a large damp patch above the bed that me and Jamie had already discussed reporting. No crimson but it definitely existed. I had also commented on a beautiful Sphynx cat roaming the halls as we were moving in. I started to get seriously freaked out.

Our dream  our beautiful little home had just become a source of fear and confusion. I checked the time and it was 9.14. Damn it. Out of time to catch postman Ian. When I opened the door to check  sure enough  two letters addressed to a Mrs Hemmings sat on the doorstep. 

At about 11.15 my worst fears were truly confirmed when a friendly middle aged looking man carrying window cleaning equipment knocked on my balcony door. I ignored him. I didn’t want to take the risk until I’d spoken to Jamie and showed him the note. I’d texted him already to rush home. I felt bad as the man rapped his knuckles against the door for over 10 minutes  but honestly the longer it went on the more I was terrified. 

My windows were sparkling  and due to our lack of curtains I couldn’t even hide from his gaze. I felt so exposed. He stayed for a total of 30 minutes exactly and never once did he stop looking at me or knocking. He shouted the occasional ultra friendly line or humble request for a beverage in the heat through the door but I did my best to avoid eye contact. 

When he finally left I looked outside every window in the flat  but I couldn’t see him on any of the other balconies or see any equipment suggesting he was around. He had vanished completely. 

Jamie still hadn’t text me back  he must have been having a rough shift  it was a Friday and they were always busy. It wasn’t often that he didn’t reply. He was due home in around an hour anyway.

I read the note probably hundreds of times over  I tortured myself reading it for the next hour. Desperately waiting for Jamie to come through the door to tell me it was all crazy and I should relax. 

I hoped for that so much.

But Jamie never came. His shift should have finished around midday but by 2pm he still wasn’t home. I panicked  I cried  I left over 100 voice messages on his phone but got nowhere. I finally decided it had been long enough that calling his work wouldn’t embarrass him and his boss told me that he had never turned up for his shift. 

I thought about it  what could have happened?  And then it hit me. Jamie’s shift started at 4am today. He would have left the flat at 3.15 and taken the lift down the stairs. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to convince myself it was all just a big joke. Maybe Jamie wrote the note and got his boss in on it. A voice in my head kept telling me that he couldn’t write like that if he tried but I had to attempt to fool myself. It’s getting late and he still isn’t home  what if it’s all true?

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.,"Three years ago I was looking at the local job classifieds online when one of the ads caught my eye  not because of what it said  but because it said so little.  Best I remember  the ad just read “Job available.  Good pay.  No benefits.  Discretion required.”  It then listed an email address and that was all.  At the time I was managing a music store  but I had already started hearing rumors we would be shutting down within the next year and the likelihood of a transfer to another store was slim. I had been morosely looking at job listings for the last few days  but this was the first one that stood out  if only because I was bored and it was weird.

So I sent an email.

Half an hour later I had a response  telling me to go to a particular office building in an upscale part of the city at a precise time for my “screening”.  I went  and after waiting for a few minutes in the lobby  I was taken into an office where I was given a series of forms and questionnaires to fill out.  They collected them and told me they would be in touch.

I had almost forgotten about the whole thing until a month later I got a call saying I had moved on to the second stage of the hiring process.  I was again given an address and time  and when I arrived (this time it was a different nice office park twenty miles away from the first one)  I was met by a man who introduced himself as Mr. Solomon.  He escorted me into a large room that contained a chair and a desk.  On the desk were two large monitors  a keyboard and mouse  and a bolted down metal box with two oversized buttons on it:  One red and one green.

He told me this room was a model for the place I would be working if I took the job.  He described the job as follows.

I would be working seven shifts of six hours every week.  My job would be simple.  I would arrive at work ten minutes early and enter an outer area that was like a locker room.  I would have my own personal locker.  I would store all belongings in the locker and change into the provided work clothes.  I was never  under any circumstances  to carry any item of my own into the surveillance room.  I was never  under any circumstances  to take any item with me from the surveillance room.

As for what I was to do in the surveillance room  I was told that the monitor on the left would constantly show a live stream from a high-definition camera in a remote location.  My job was simply to watch the camera.  Once an hour I would get onto the computer attached to the right monitor and enter a brief log describing anything interesting that occurred in the last hour.  I would have no pens or pencils or paper  and I should never try to take any kind of written notes about the work.

As for the red and green buttons  the red button was only to be used if there was an emergency.  This meant something on the video or in my workspace that required outside help.  The green button was to be hit if I saw something on the video feed that was particularly noteworthy.  It would tell other people somewhere that  at least in my opinion  something interesting was going on.  Solomon stressed that while I was given discretion on when to use this button  I should err on the side of only using it if and when something “of real significance” occurred.

He pointed out the camera on the ceiling of the room we were in.  He said the real room would be the same.  My work would be observed  and other people were watching the room on the video feed as well.  He said I was only a redundancy in case other systems failed.  He then smirked and asked if I knew what he meant by redundancy.

I nodded  trying not to show my irritation.  I don’t talk that good to people  so sometimes they think I’m dumb.  That’s okay.  Let him think that if he paid me good enough.

The pay was very good.  Thirty-five dollars an hour.  

This worried me.  I was already thinking this was some kind of psych experiment or secret government job  which I was okay with.  But that kind of money to sit and watch a screen?  My mom always told me that if something seems too good to be true  it probably is  and this was seeming too good to be true.

I asked if I was going to be doing anything illegal.  Solomon laughed and said no.  I asked if anyone was going to get hurt.  Again  he shook his head no.  He said the reason they were paying so much was because they needed employees that were motivated to be professional and discrete.  The work they were doing was important  and for various reasons it couldn’t be discussed.  If I took the job  I would have to sign papers promising I would never discuss my work there or I could be sued or locked up.  I’m only breaking that now because of everything that’s happened.

So I took the job  and because they wanted me to start right away  I had to quit the store with no notice.  I felt bad about that  but I was excited about the new job too.  It was a lot of money and seemed like easy enough work  if a bit boring.  I was nervous that there was something more to it  but I told myself I would just have to see.  No point in chickening out and wasting a good chance because I let my imagination go crazy.
I was given the location of the job itself  and when I went there  I was amazed that it really was just like the model room I had been shown with only a few differences.  There was a locker room you had to pass through to enter the surveillance room and there was a small bathroom attached to the real surveillance room also.  The real room had a small water cooler in the corner  but because I wasn’t allowed to bring anything in with me  I had to eat before or after every shift.  The biggest difference  of course  was that the monitors were turned on.

The right monitor was just a black and white terminal like you see in movies some times.  I could type in my logs  but no internet to look at or anything like that.  The left monitor…

It was video from a room.  You would call it a bedroom I guess  because it had a bed in it  but it had lots of other stuff too.  A T.V.  a sofa and chairs  a couple of tables  and plenty of empty space in between.  The camera must be high up in a corner  because I could see pretty much everything except for the far sides of furniture.  At first though  I didn’t notice any of that stuff.  

All I saw was her.

She looked to be a little older than me and was very pretty.  When I first saw her  she was laying on her side on the sofa.  That was the part of the room farthest from the camera  but the picture was very clear and I could tell that she was sleeping.  I found myself leaning into the monitor more so I could see her better  and then I thought about what I was doing and felt embarrassed.  It’s like I was spying on her.  A Peeping Tom  my mom used to call it.

I didn’t want to be a Peeping Tom  but I didn’t want to be silly either.  I needed to think about it slow.  

It was a good job.  And I wasn’t doing anything wrong  right?  I wasn’t hurting anybody.  The woman looked fine.  And the room was nice.  She probably agreed to be there and it’s all some experiment or something.  I was just overreacting.

So I sat down in the chair and began my work.

**** 

It didn’t take long before I understood more.  The woman  I took to calling her Rachel  wasn’t there of her free will.  I never saw her hurt  but it was clear that she never left that room except to go into what I think is a bathroom area that my camera couldn’t see.  Well  she never left the room on her own.  Periodically  usually a couple of times a week during my shifts  men and women in strange-looking outfits would come in and take her from the room.  Sometimes she would struggle  but usually she would just go along with her head hung low.

They would always bring her back  though the times when she wasn’t brought back during my shift were always the worst for me.  I would worry about her until I got to work the next day and saw her in the room watching T.V. or painting.  She never looked hurt or even that upset except for when they took her  and even when she fought  they were always gentle with her.  

Still  I knew something was wrong.  I considered quitting the job  or hitting the red button and getting someone to come so I could get some answers.  Or calling the police and showing them what the camera was showing me.

Except I was scared.  Scared of losing my job   and scared of what these people might do to me if I quit or told on them.  Solomon had told me when I took the job that part of being discreet was not asking questions.  I would never be asked to do more than I had already been told  but I could never tell anyone what I did or saw  and I could never ask questions about what I was doing or why.

So I made excuses.  It was all an experiment.  She was crazy or sick and they were trying to help her.  She was doing a job just like I was.  Or if she really was a prisoner somewhere  at least I was watching to make sure that she was okay.  If they ever tried to hurt her  or I saw that she really didn’t want to be there for sure  I could get help then.  In a way  I told myself  I was helping to protect her by watching.

I don’t expect you to think much of my excuses.  I don’t think much of them myself  especially now.  But in my defense  when things changed  I didn’t ignore it or try to explain it away.  I knew something had to be done.

****

Rachel would usually paint for an hour or two every day  and it seemed to always be during my afternoon shifts.  The room had no windows as far as I could tell  but I guess she either used a clock or her own body’s time to keep to a kind of schedule.  I always liked to watch her paint—the thing she was painting was always facing the wrong way for me to see it  but I could see her face as she worked.  She always looked peaceful and happy when she was painting  and seeing her that way  smiling serenely from time to time as she got something the way she wanted it  always made my day.

I first noticed something was wrong when she started painting more frequently a few weeks ago.  Her expression was more focused and serious  and there was a tension to her movements that I wasn’t used to seeing.  At first I thought she was just really trying to work hard on something  and I wanted to tell her not to worry.  Every few weeks the others would come in and take the old paintings out anyway  bringing in a new stack of…I think the word is canvas.

But it was more than her being focused.  Something was wrong.  She didn’t look happy and she was going for hours at a time.  In the span of three days  she had finished four paintings.

I had been growing more and more worried watching her work  and when she finished the fourth  I found myself telling her to just stop and rest awhile.  I had grown accustomed to talking to the monitor  talking to *her* in my own way.  But she didn’t stop.  Instead she began moving the paintings.  Arranging them on the back and seat of the long sofa at the far end of the room.  

This was the first time I had gotten to see any of the paintings.  Even when the others were taking them out  they always seemed to be turned away from the camera.  I was still worried about her  but I was also happy to finally see something she had worked on.  Happy and amazed.

They were beautiful.  One was a beautiful green forest.  Another was an old stone well.  A third was a house sitting alone on a small island.  The last was an old-fashioned looking movie theater.  All of them looked like something out of a dream  with trailing lines of color mixing in the air around them like leaves caught in a wind.  It was only when I looked close that I realized the lines of color weren’t random.  They were words.  Easy to miss if you weren’t looking close  and by themselves  they didn’t seem to mean much.  Just the ghost of a word somewhere in each of the paintings  easy to lose in everything else that was being shown.

I leaned into the monitor and squinted  trying to read the words.  Then my heart started thudding as I made them out.  Blinking and rubbing my eyes  I looked again  reading them out loud in order—left to right  top pair then bottom.

“Please.”

“Help.”

“Me.”

“Thomas.”

I pushed back from the monitor  my hand over my mouth.  I didn’t know what to do.  I didn’t know how any of this could be happening.  It wasn’t just that she was asking for help  though that was a big part of it.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,Something happened 63 years ago that's haunted me my entire life. I’ve never told anyone about it—until now.,"It’s official: I’m an old man.

For the last couple years  I’ve comforted myself by saying I’m in my “early 70s ” but math is simple and unforgiving. Today is my 75th birthday  and God  the years do fly.

I’m not here for your well wishes; this is hardly a milestone I’m excited about. I’m glad to still be here  of course  but I find I have less and less to live for with every passing year. My bones ache  my kids live far away  and the other side of my bed has been empty for just over eight months now. In fact  once I cast my vote against that goddamned Trump this November  I may have nothing to live for at all.

So spare me your “happy birthdays” and your congratulations  if you please. I’m here because I have a story for you  and it’s one I’ve never told before. I used to think I kept it inside because it was silly  or maybe because nobody would believe it. I’ve found  though  that the older you grow  the more exhausting it becomes to lie to yourself. If I’m being perfectly honest  I’ve never told anybody this story because it scares me  almost to death. 

But death seems friendlier than it used to  so listen close.

*****

The year was 1950; the setting a small town in Maine. I was a boy of nine  rather small for my age  with only one friend in the world to speak of—and his family  seemingly on a whim  decided to move 2 000 miles away. It was shaping up to be the worst summer of my life.

My pop wasn’t around and my mom was a chore-whore—boy  was I proud of myself when I came up with that one—so I wasn’t apt to hang around the house. With some hesitation  I decided the public library was the place to be that summer. The library’s collection of books  particularly children’s books  was meager to say the least. But within the walls of that miserly structure  I would find no undone chores  no nagging mother (God rest her soul)  and perhaps most importantly  no other children with whom I would be expected to associate. I was the only kid with a low enough social status to spend his precious days of freedom sulking amid the bookshelves  and that was just fine with me.

The first half of my summer was even more dreadful than I had imagined it would be. I would sleep in until 10  do my chores  and then ride my bike to the library (and by bike  I mean rusty log of shit attached to a pair of wheels). Once there  I would split my time between unintentionally annoying the elderly patrons and deliberately doing so. One pleasant lady actually interrupted my incessant tongue-clicking to hiss a “shut the fuck up!” at me—the first time I ever heard a grownup use The F Word. Big fuckin’ deal  I know  but in those days it was unheard of.

The dreary days turned to woeful weeks. I had actually begun praying for school to start again—until I discovered the basement. I could have sworn I’d roamed every inch of that library  but one day  in the far corner behind the foreign language collection I stumbled across a small wooden door I had never seen before. That was where it all began.

The door was windowless and made from oak that looked far older than the wall in which it rested. It had a knob of black metal that quite literally looked ancient—I wouldn’t have been surprised to learn it was crafted in the 17th century. Engraved on the knob was what appeared to be a single footprint. I had the sense that whatever lay beyond this door was forbidden to me  and therefore probably the most interesting thing I would encounter all summer. I quickly glanced around to make sure nobody was watching me  then turned the heavy knob  slipped behind the door  and shut it.

There was nothing; only darkness. I took a couple of steps and then stopped  unnerved by the totality of the shadow which surrounded me. I waved my hands in front of me in an attempt to find a wall or a shelf or anything to hold on to. What I actually found was far more subtle—a small string  dangling from above—but far more useful. I grabbed it firmly and pulled it down.

Back in the day  lots of lightbulbs were operated with strings  and this was one of them. My surroundings were instantly illuminated. I was standing on a small  dusty platform that looked as though it hadn’t seen life in quite some time. To my left was a crickety-ass spiral staircase  made of wood and appearing ready to collapse at any second. The bulb was the only source of light in the room  and it was feeble  so when I peered over the railing to see what lay below  the bottom of the staircase dissolved into the darkness.

I was beginning to feel scared. This place—wherever I was—seemed to have no business in a town library. It was as though I were in a completely different building. But no nine-year-old likes to let a mystery go unsolved. Looking back  I wish I could tell my prepubescent self to turn around  go back  do anything else besides descending that staircase. “You’ll be spared a lot of sleepless nights ” I’d say. But  of course  I didn’t know that then—and I may not have listened even if I had. So instead of turning back  I took a deep breath  gripped the railing  and glared resolutely forward as I began my descent.

The wood on the railing was dry and covered with splinters. I immediately let go  holding my hands out for balance as I carefully traversed the staircase. It was (or at least seemed) very long  and with only the dim glow from the string-bulb far above me  my heart pounded mercilessly in the darkness. Even kids can sense when something isn’t right  I think—they just don’t always give a shit.

By the time my feet reached the cement floor at the bottom  the light from the bulb above was very nearly a memory. But there was a new light source  and God  I’ll never forget it. Directly in front of me was a door  massive  and a deep shade of red. The light was coming from behind the door  and it shone out in thin lines from all four sides—a sinister  dimly glowing rectangle. For the second time  I took a deep breath and went through a door I shouldn’t have.

In contrast to the dank room I entered from  the room behind the door was blinding. When my eyes adjusted  what I saw nearly took my breath away. 

It was a library. The most perfect library imaginable.

I gaped in wonder as I stepped  almost reverently  further into the room. It was beautiful. It was smaller than the library above  much smaller  but it seemed to be almost tailor-made for me. The shelves were packed with brightly colored titles  both armchairs in the middle of the room were exquisitely comfortable  and the smell—my God  the smell—was simply unbelievable. Sort of a mixture of citrus and pine. I simply can’t do it justice with words  so I’ll suffice it to say that I’ve never smelled anything better. Not in my 75 years.

What was this room? Why had I never heard of it before? Why was nobody else here? Those were the questions I should have been asking. But I was intoxicated. As I gazed around at all the books and basked in the smell of paradise  I could only form one thought: *I will never be bored again.* 

*****

In truth  boredom only hid from me for three years. It was on my 12th birthday  63 years ago to this day  that everything changed.

Before that day  I visited my basement sanctuary as often as I could—usually several times a week. I never saw another soul down there  yet strangely remained free of suspicion. I never removed a book from that room  but instead would pick up a particular volume wherever I had stopped reading during my previous visit. I sat  always in the same deep purple armchair  and always leaving its twin barren and directly across from myself. That armchair was mine  the other was—well  I suppose I couldn’t have articulated it then much better than I can now. But it wasn’t mine  that’s for damn sure.

On my twelfth birthday  I arrived later than usual. My mom had invited a couple classmates and some cousins over to our house to celebrate  a gesture which I found more tedious than touching—really  I just wanted to spend my birthday sitting and reading and smelling paradise. Eventually  our guests went home  and I made it to the library about fifteen minutes before closing time. That didn’t matter; the workers never checked down there before they locked up. I was free to stay as late as I wished. This particular night  I was devouring the final chapters of an epic adventure; knights  swords  dragons  and the like. I didn’t smell it until I read the final words and closed the book.

The once exquisite aroma of that room had turned sour. I sat for a moment  unsettled. Objectively  I could recognize that the smell was actually the same as it had been before—that mixture of citrus and pine. I just perceived it differently  and I didn’t like it anymore. It was the nasal version of an optical illusion; you know  the one that looks like a young woman glancing backward  but all of a sudden you see that it’s really an old woman facing toward you? You can’t unsee that  and I couldn’t unsmell this. The spell was broken.

The odor also seemed  for the first time  to be coming from somewhere specific. With a fair amount of trepidation  I stalked around the room  sniffing the air like a crazed canine until I came to a shelf near the back. The shelf was perfectly normal  with the exception of one title—a large  leatherbound cover of solid faded maroon  with one striking black footprint at the top of the spine. This was the source of the smell. I opened the front cover  and saw one sentence scrawled neatly in blood-red ink atop the first page: 

*Rest your sorrows down  friend  and leave them where they lie.*

I stared at this sentence  mesmerized  as I began to retreat to my chair. I turned a page. Blank. The smell became stronger. Another page  blank  and the smell grew stronger still. I stopped for a moment  suppressed a gag  and continued walking. Then  as I neared the armchairs  I turned one final page—and there  in the same sinister print  was the last thing I expected to see: my own name. I dropped the book. I began to sprint toward the door  but as I shifted my gaze forward  my heart leapt to my throat and I stopped in my tracks.

The empty chair wasn’t empty anymore.

An aged man in a suit sat before me  one leg crossed over the other  contemplating me with piercing gray eyes and a light smirk. This was all too much. I fell to my knees and expelled the contents of my stomach onto the carpet. I wiped my mouth  staring at my vomit  when I heard the man let out a chuckle.

I stared at him disbelievingly. “Who are you?” I asked  panic in my voice.

The man leapt to his feet  grabbed me gently by the shoulders  and helped me to my chair. He sat  once again  in his own. “I fear we got off to a bad start ” he said  glancing at the pile of sick on the carpet. “The smell . . . it does take some getting used to.”

“Who are you?” I repeated.

“Tonight  you will know hardship like you’ve never before known ” he said. “I come as a friend  offering you refuge from it  and from all other storms which lie ahead.”

I wanted nothing more than to leave at that moment  but I remained seated. I asked him what he was talking about.

“Your mother is dead  my boy. By her own hand  in her kitchen. The scene is gruesome  I must admit ” he said in sorrowful tones  but was there a playful glint in his eye? “Surely you wish to avoid this path. I can show you a safer one.”

My blood ran cold at the horrors this man spoke of  but I did not believe him. “What do you want with me?” I demanded  trying to sound braver than I felt. He laughed  an old  raspy yelp that seemed to shake him to his bones.

“Nothing but your friendship  dear boy ” he said. Then  sensing I found his answer inadequate  he expounded. “I want you to come on a journey with me. My work is noble and you will make a fine apprentice. And maybe  when I’m done”—he sighed tiredly  running his bony fingers through his thin white hair—“maybe then  my work can be yours.”

I stood up  shuffling toward the door but never breaking his gaze. “You’re crazy ” I told him. “My mom isn’t dead. She’s not.”

“See for yourself  if you must ” he said  gesturing toward the door. I threw him a contemptuous glare and bolted for the exit. As my hand closed around the knob  he said my name softly. In spite of myself  I turned around.

“Your road won’t be easy  friend. If it ever becomes too much for you  and I mean ever ” he said  pausing to sweep his hand over the room  “you know where to find me.”

I slammed the door behind me and took the decrepit stairs two at a time. I exited the library  clambered onto my bike  and high-tailed it home. The front door was wide open. I dismounted  leaving my bike in a heap on the ground  and approached the house cautiously. The old man was lying—he must have been. Still  tears began to sting my eyes. Heart pounding  I stepped inside and called for my mother. I heard no answer  so I turned into the kitchen.

To this day  I don’t know why she did it.

*****

I’ve lived in that small town in Maine my entire life  although I’ve kept mostly clear of the public library. Once  in my late 20s  I summoned the courage to step inside. Life was good at that time  and my fear had begun to morph into idle curiosity. Where the door to my basement sanctuary once stood was only a blank wall. I asked the librarian what had become of that basement  though in my heart I knew the answer. There was no basement  she said. There had never been a basement. In fact  if she had her facts correctly  city zoning ordinances prohibited a basement in the area.

I’ve been haunted by that sickly-sweet smell  that poisonous blend of citrus and pine  ever since that long ago birthday. When I saw my mother in the kitchen that day  collapsed in a pool of her own blood  I smelled it. When a man claiming to be my father knocked on my college apartment door  begged me for money and beat me to within an inch of my life when I refused  I smelled it. When my wife miscarried our second child  I smelled it  and again when she miscarried our fourth. When our oldest son got behind the wheel of the family Buick completely shitfaced and got his girlfriend killed  I smelled it.

I began to smell it periodically as my wife became sick. She died late last year  and now  I’m alone for the first time in more than half a century. Now  I smell it every day  and it feels like an invitation.

A few months ago  I went back to the library and the small oak door with the ancient handle was there—right where it used to be. My evening walk has brought me past that library every day since  but I haven’t gone inside. Maybe tonight I will. I’m frightened to die  yes  but lately I’m even more frightened to keep living. The old man was right—my road hasn’t been easy  and I doubt it will get any easier.

*Rest your sorrows down  friend  and leave them where they lie.*

He promised relief. A refuge  he said. Was he right about that too? There’s only one way to find out. After all  I still know where to find him.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,Spacegirl,"We called her Spacegirl.   


Her real name was Megan Daniels  but nobody actually called her that. She’d been Spacegirl since Grade 2. She was the kind of kid who stuck out in the crowd with her long red hair  ghostly pale skin and coke bottle glasses. For as long as I’d known her  Spacegirl had been quiet. She didn’t like to be around us. She didn’t play with us when we were kids  she didn’t even talk much.  


Most of the time  she’d find somewhere to sit  far away from everyone else. Then she’d open up her little notebook and scribble inside of it. Sometimes she wrote poems  sometimes she drew. But she was always off on her own little world. Nowadays  I understand why we targeted her. She was different  and she was alone. That doesn’t justify any of it  but kids can be cruel. I remember that it was Sasha Brown who told me that Spacegirl was retarded because her Mother was on drugs. She probably just made that up. But we all believed it. She had always been the worst towards Spacegirl  and she kept that up until the end.   


It all started in Grade 5 when Sasha took her notebook.

It had been raining that day  so we’d had an indoor recess. Spacegirl sat in the corner at her desk  eyes focused on her notebook as she methodically worked on a drawing. Sasha and I had been sitting nearby at our desks  and we simply just watched her do her thing.

  “I can’t believe they let that retard sit in with us.” Sasha murmured  “Look at her… Why do they even let them in schools? They aren’t gonna learn anything.”  
   “Better than leaving her at home with her crackhead Mom.” Said Tanya Evrett. She and I weren’t exactly friends  but she sat close to Sasha and I. “My Dad says he sees a different car in front of her house every day. He says that she lets boys come and they pay her so they can have S-E-X.” None of us could actually say the dreaded S word at the time. Sex was still a terrible unknown thing  and we all had been raised to believe that nobody decent would ever do it.  


Spacegirl paused  and her eyes darted away from her book  to look at us. I can only imagine she’d heard us. Sasha just stared right back at her.   


  “What? Do you have a problem  Spacegirl?” She asked. The Teacher was out of earshot  and that gave her carte blanche to say whatever she wanted. Spacegirl didn’t respond. She just looked back down at her notebook  but Sasha had been challenged (or at least she thought she’d been). She looked over to the Teachers desk to make sure she was busy  then she got up and moved closer to Spacegirl. 

  “What are you even doing in there  retard?” 

She’d reached out to snatch the book before Spacegirl could stop her. 

  “What even is this? A Unicorn? What are you  five?” 

She handed the book to me  and I took it on instinct. There was a brightly colored drawing of a Unicorn inside. The artwork was actually pretty nice  but I would never have said so. The book was passed on to Tanya next  and Spacegirl could only look at us helplessly. 

  “Wow. You can’t even draw. Look at this?”

She tore the page out of the notebook  and Spacegirl let out a startled whimper  as if she’d been struck. The picture was crumpled up and the book was thrown on the floor by Spacegirls desk.

  “Draw something that isn’t trash next time.” Tanya said  and Sasha just giggled as if it was anything other than being mean spirited just for the sake of it. 

Spacegirl slowly picked her book up off the floor  avoiding eye contact as Tanya and Sasha turned away from her. I continued to stare. I remember that the way she moved was so defeated  as if she were shrinking in on herself. She looked up at me  but only for a moment and I felt bad for her. I really did. But I didn’t do anything about it. I just left her to rejoin the others.

&#x200B;

After that  Spacegirl became an easy target for Sasha and Tanya. Every chance they got  they’d harass her and I regret to admit that I was usually right there with them.

During the days where we could go outside for recess  Spacegirl would always sit beneath the same tree  always working in her notebook. When she did  we would always lean on the trunk and look down over Spacegirls shoulder.

  “Wow  that’s really good  Spacegirl.” Was how most of her comments would start  “Did you mean to draw it like it got hit by a truck  or is that just your style?”

There was never a compliment. She would always find something to needle.

  “Can you draw me?” Sasha asked once  “I heard that retards were always like  art geniuses or something. Maybe it’ll even look like a person!”

Spacegirl didn’t look up at her. She seemed to be trying not to acknowledge the insults. I won’t pretend like I was blameless either. I never stopped them  and there were plenty of times where I was right there  making fun of her because that was what we did  and we weren’t the only ones. More or less everyone hurt her in some way or another. But she never complained. I think she was too scared to.

&#x200B;

It was late December in 7th grade where things got even worse. I don’t know all the details  and I don’t know just for how long things had been boiling over  but I’d heard a rumor that James Hardy had it out for Spacegirl.  


James had only been in my class a few times  and he wasn’t in my class that year. He was a small  mousy looking kid who was convinced he was the world's toughest gangster. The rumors said that someone had seen his Dad going into Spacegirls house. Naturally there had been speculation that they'd been having sex. Someone told me that James’ parents had been divorcing because of it. Somehow all of these rumors had mutated into claims that James and Spacegirl were dating and I think that was what had rubbed him the wrong way.  


We were coming in from recess when some boys decided to pull a little prank on James. The whole prank had been set up by Brian Jordan and his brother Mike. They had some mistletoe for the Holiday season  and had set it up in the hall leading back to our classroom. Mike had grabbed Spacegirl during recess and were holding her behind the door where the mistletoe was. When James walked through  they pushed her at him and snapped a picture. I’d been just behind James when it happened. I watched as Spacegirl came flying out of seemingly nowhere  eyes wide and afraid  then slammed into James. They both hit the ground  and I could hear the other boys laughing.  


  “LOOK! She wanted to give you a kiss!” One the boys said. Spacegirl was trying to crawl away from James and pick up her notebook  but somebody had kicked it out of sight. I remember that she looked back towards James  and there were tears in her eyes. She must have been terrified with everything that was going on. She clearly hadn’t wanted any part in this  but there she was at the center of it.

 “You fucking faggot assholes!” James yelled as he picked himself up.

  “Hey  she just wanted to give you a smooch!” aughed Brian  “Come on  give her a kiss!” 

Someone pushed Spacegirl towards James  and he glared at her as if all of this was her fault. She tried to stand and run  but he was angry and he wasn’t thinking straight. I watched as he grabbed her and hit her. A square punch to the jaw. Then he tossed her to the ground and went after Brian next. A teacher had to get in to pull James off of him. He  Spacegirl and the Jordan Brothers ended up getting suspended right before the Christmas holidays. We didn’t see Spacegirl until January… we didn’t see James or his friends ever again. 

&#x200B;

On Christmas Eve  there was a car accident on the highway outside of my town. Supposedly it had swerved off the road to avoid an animal of some kind  and gone into a ditch. Mike  Brian and their parents didn’t survive. On December 27th  James was killed while outside shoveling his driveway. My Parents told me that he’d been attacked by an animal. Probably a deer or something. But that seemed so unusual… I’d never heard anything about deer attacking people before. Especially not in my area.  


I went over to Sasha’s house on the day before New Years. We’d both gotten some gift cards for Christmas and we were planning to walk to the mall together to use them. Her parents weren’t home  they both had to work. So it was just us when I got there.

  “Hey! Kept me waiting!” She said when I knocked on the door.   
   “Sorry.”   
   “It’s fine. I’ll be ready in a bit. Come on upstairs  I wanna show you something!”

I didn’t question what it was. I figured it was just something else she’d gotten for Christmas  so I went upstairs with her.

  “You’re gonna love it.” She promised me  “It’s gonna be so funny…”

She led me to her bedroom  and as soon as she opened the door  I spotted a familiar notebook on her desk.  
   “Where did you get this?” I asked  walking closer to it.

  “Spacegirl dropped it when Brian and his Brother pulled that prank the other day  she dropped it. I may have grabbed it… Y’know. Just for safekeeping.”  


She cracked a wry grin  before opening the notebook.  


  “Look at this… She’s been drawing the same damn Unicorns forever. She didn’t even finish this one!”

She paused at one small picture that was labeled ‘The Unicorn Prince’. It depicted an empty field with a blank space where the titular Prince should have been. Sasha flipped through the pages a little more until she got to the newer ones.

  
  “I figured since they kicked Spacegirl out for a little while  and her Mom is too poor to get her anything for the holidays  I’d step up! What do you think?” Sasha wasn’t anywhere near as good of an artist as Spacegirl was  but the simple detail in what she had drawn turned my stomach.

  
In her first picture  Spacegirl was hanging from a rope. Her tongue was hanging out  and her eyes were closed.   
In the second one  Spacegirl had a gun in her mouth.   
In the third one  she was standing on the edge of a building. 

Sasha giggled as I flipped through her crude depictions of suicide. There were pages of them.

  “What do you think?” She asked with a grin  “I’ll bet she’ll lose her shit!”

I closed the notebook and looked over at Sasha.

  “A-are you out of your mind?” I asked. Sasha’s grin faded.

  “What do you mean?”

  “You stole her notebook  just so you could draw these? Sasha  that’s really messed up!”  
   “It’s Spacegirl  who the hell cares about Spacegirl  Jane?”

  “You just… drew her killing herself over and over again!” I took the book off her desk  “Do you not understand what’s wrong with that?”

Sasha just stared at me like I was crazy.

  “Fine. Sue me for trying to be funny.” Sasha said  “Just give it here…” She outstretched a hand to take the notebook  but I pulled back from her. 

  “No. You’re just going to put something else in there.”

Anger flared in Sasha’s eyes.

  “Jane  just give me the book.”

  “No!”  


I opened the book  and I started to tear out those pages of Spacegirls suicide. Sasha lunged for me  trying to grab at the book and stop me  but  pushed her back. I didn’t mean to push so hard  but I did and she fell  landing hard on the ground. For a moment  Sasha looked up at me  wide eyed and shocked. I don’t think anyone had laid a hand on her like that before. Then I saw something in her eyes… Not just anger. Something worse. It was the same thing that had prompted her to draw those horrible pictures of Spacegirl. I turned and I ran  bolting down her stairs and out her front door  back into the snow. I clutched Spacegirls notebook to my chest the entire time and I didn’t let it go until I got home.

&#x200B;

I spent the rest of the Christmas break terrified that my parents would get a call from Sasha’s. I’d pushed her  and that seemed like such a big deal at the time. In hindsight  I doubt Sasha would have told her parents what had happened. They would have asked why I’d pushed her  and I would have told them about the notebook. On some level  she must have known that what she’d done was wrong. She was a cruel person  but there was a limit. Part of me hoped that she’d realize that I was right and we could patch things up when School started again  but honestly I wasn’t so sure.   


I remember looking through Spacegirls drawings. The ones that she’d done. I remembered the ones I’d made fun of the most. There was one with a mermaid on a rock  combing her hair. Her eyes were closed in a relaxed bliss. I remembered saying how stupid her facial expression had looked  but honestly  I kinda liked it. I flipped through the pages some more  through Unicorns  Fairies and Castles. But I paused at the page depicting the Unicorn Prince. Back at Sasha’s place  it had been blank  but at my house it was finished. The Unicorn Prince stood proudly in his field  looking skywards with his horn proudly displayed. Maybe I had been thinking of a different picture?  


I brushed it off and flipped to the back where Sasha’s pictures were. One by one  I started tearing them out of the notebook and tossing them in the trash. It was a waste of paper  but I refused to give it back to Spacegirl with those images still in it. 

&#x200B;

On the first day back to school  I was up early. I made sure the notebook was packed into my bag and was out as early as I could be. The snow on the ground was almost pristine as I walked to school  but I remember seeing some tracks on my lawn  headed down the side of my house. Deep U shaped indents that looked like they’d been made by hooves. A deer perhaps? I didn’t dwell on them and made my way down the freshly shoveled sidewalk and back to school.   


I wasn’t entirely sure if Spacegirl would be back yet  but she was. She was alone in the classroom  sitting at her desk and drawing in a brand new notebook. She paused briefly when I walked in to join her  and I could see her sideying me. She didn’t say a word as I drew nearer  but I thought I saw her shoulders tense up ever so slightly.

  “Hey.” I said  “I’m… I hope you had a nice Holiday.”

She didn’t respond.

  “I’m sorry about what happened the other day. I didn’t know anything about it  but it just seemed really mean spirited.”

Still no answer. I reached into my backpack  taking out her old notebook. I put it on her desk in front of her. She stared at it  still silent  then back at me.

  “Sasha took it. I was over at her house the other day and she showed it to me. I had to take some pages out  but she drew some really awful things in there. I didn’t think it would be right to give it back with those things in there…” I paused  feeling smaller as Spacegirl stared at me. She didn’t seem angry or thankful. She didn’t seem anything at all. Just stoic.

  “I’m sorry if I wasn’t all that great to you before.” I said  and then I shuffled off to by desk. Spacegirl waited until I sat down before she opened her notebook and inspected it. Then she closed her new book  and started something new on a fresh page in her old one. 

It wasn’t much. But it made me feel at least a little good for what I’d done.

&#x200B;

When Sasha got in  she didn’t talk to me. She didn’t even look at me. Neither did Tanya or any of our other mutual friends. I knew from the moment they walked in that I’d burned my bridges with them. But I still wanted to try.

The Teacher hadn’t come in yet  so I figured it might be worth it to try and talk to Sasha. I got up to move closer to her and she gave me a look of utter disgust.  


  “What do you want?” She spat. 

Now it was my turn to be silent.  


  “Fuck off and leave us alone.” Tanya said  “You’d obviously rather hang out with the fucking retard than us  and I really don’t want you spreading your retard germs to us. It’s a quarantine issue.”   


I stared at both of them  and I could’ve sworn I knew how Spacegirl felt… What was I supposed to say to any of that? Instead  I just returned to my desk without a word. Spacegirl stared at me the entire time. Her pencil rested over her notebook  but she didn’t write anything. She set it down  tore out the page she’d been writing on and jammed it into her pocket. I later saw her toss it into the trash during lunch.

&#x200B;

I didn’t really have anyone left… So I thought that maybe it might be a good idea to pull it out. Maybe it was something she wasn’t happy with? I’d never seen her throw a drawing out before. I was thinking that maybe I could use it as a peace offering of sorts  or something along those lines. When I saw what she’d written on it  I almost threw it back into the trash.   


**Your Words**

*There is a land where your sorry may go.*

*A sickening land where it always snows*

*The snow is putrid in color and smell*

*It's substance- filth and things I won't tell.*

*Only your Father has been there before.*

*One day your boyfriend will visit once more.*

*This place in your carcass this humanoid hell.*

*Your sorry can go there to this hole in your shell*

*My unsubtle message  this subtextual jazz.*

*Is take your apology and stuff it up your ass.*  


This was unlike anything I’d ever seen her write. It was so crass and spiteful… This was as close to hatred as she could have gotten. I understood why she’d thrown it out. It didn’t fit with everything else she’d done. Those things had been beautiful  despite what people had said to her. This was angry and ugly… This was something she’d written for me. I put it in my pocket. I wasn’t going to give it back to her  but I wanted to keep it. I wanted to remember the way I’d made her feel. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eighth grade wasn’t fun for me. 

I had very few friends left  and Sasha never forgave me for turning on her. Her version of the story was slowly warped as time went on. First I’d punched her and stolen the book. Then I’d tried to kiss her  punched her when she’d refused  then stole the book to try and get her in trouble. Rumors of me being a dyke spread pretty quickly  and hot on their heels came the rumors that I was dating Spacegirl. I tried not to let them bother me too much. I knew the truth and at the end of the day  I’d done the right thing.

&#x200B;

By the time High School rolled around  I was hoping for a fresh start. There were new faces  and I figured I could make friends with them before Sashas rumors spread. I had a bit of success in that department. I fell in with a better crowd at least.   


Sasha stuck with her same old clique. It grew ever so slightly  but she was determined to live out the movie Mean Girls and most people didn’t pay her any mind.   
Spacegirl barely changed at all. I didn’t see her much when High School started. She was in a few of my classes  but I rarely saw her outside of them. Whenever she had a moment  she’d be in the library  usually in one of the corner cubicles  working on her drawings. Sometimes I thought about talking to her and trying to strike up a friendship… but it never felt right.   


Sasha’s bullying never let up of course. Of course she stalked Spacegirl to the library where she’d pull the same old shit she’d been pulling since the fifth grade. She’d leer over her cubicle and comment on her drawings. Picking them apart just like she always had. I stopped her whenever I saw it… but I didn’t always see it.

  “Coming to her rescue again  huh Jane?” Sasha asked once when I’d interrupted her. Tanya leered at me from behind her  chewing gum with her mouth open. 

  “What’s she ever done to you anyways?” I asked  “She’s just minding her own business.”

  “Oh? What’s she done to you  dyke?” Sasha hissed. She leaned down over her cubicle and looked down at the notebook.

  “Unicorns… Unicorns  unicorns  fucking unicorns… When are you going to grow up Spacegirl?”  
   “Hey! I told you to stop.” I rounded the cubicle and I saw Sasha recoil. For a moment  I saw a bit of fear in her eyes. It vanished quickly and was replaced with a familiar rage.  


  “Fine.” She said  “Tan  let’s leave the happy couple to their alone time.”  
She pulled away from the cubicle and disappeared with Tanya nipping at her heels like a faithful terrier. 

Spacegirl remained hunched over her notebook  her long red hair spilling over her shoulders. She seemed impossibly still.

I turned to leave her when I heard:

  “Thanks.”

I looked back at her and saw that she was looking at me.

  “Um… You’re welcome.” I said  “Let me know if she bothers you again  alright?”

  “I will. But… you’re usually there anyways.” 

Her voice was soft and low. I’d heard it before  but I don’t remember her ever speaking directly to me.

  “Yeah  well. It’s just not right. She’s such a child. One of these days she’s going to have to grow up.”

Spacegirl just nodded  looking over towards the library door  then back down at her notebook again. 

For a moment  I thought about asking her about what she was drawing. I thought about saying something else  but… No. I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. I left her alone again. 

&#x200B;

In tenth grade  I took art as an elective. I wasn’t much of an artist  but I figured it would be an easy course. To the surprise of no one  Spacegirl was there. I actually asked her to work with me on a few group projects. I think the prospect of being asked to work together was foreign to her. She looked at me suspiciously when I did it  but when she smiled  it was the biggest smile I’d ever seen.  


I went to her house for the first time to work on a portrait project with her once. We were supposed to take turns drawing portraits of each other and I’d volunteered to let her draw me first. Rumors of her Mother had always surrounded Spacegirl  so I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when I got there. I certainly wasn’t expecting the quiet  neatly kept house that I found.  


The Woman who answered the door looked like an older version of her daughter  sans the coke bottle glasses.

  “You must be Jane.” She said. She wasn’t smiling  but she didn’t sound upset either.

  “Yes ma’am…”

  “Come on in. Megan's upstairs. She was just getting ready for you.”

The house was warm with plenty of knick knacks on the walls. Plates and porcelain dolls mostly. Her Mom sent me upstairs and I didn't waste any time. On the landing leading up to Spacegirls room  I could see a mural of family photos and paused to look at them. I could recognize Spacegirl and her Mother in most of them. Spacegirl never seemed to be smiling. I only saw her Father in a few of the very early pictures. Spacegirl looked like she was only a young child in the few pictures I saw him in though. I didn’t dwell for long and headed towards what I assumed was her room. The cardboard stars and planets on it gave it away.  


Sure enough  she was inside waiting for me. She sat facing the door behind an easel in the center of her room. Her bed was neatly made and tucked away in the corner. She had a clean little desk that she’d clearly been working on and had set a chair out for me to sit on. I hadn’t expected something so overwhelmingly formal and I almost started laughing… But then I noticed her walls.  


They weren’t just covered in drawings. The art pieces on them were full on paintings. They were the same fantasy depictions she usually did  but the colors were so vivid. The clouds looked like fluffy pillows and the castles seemed great and infinite.

  “Holy shit  are these yours?”

  “They are.” Spacegirl said softly. She stood up and took the plate of cookies from me  then moved it to her desk.

  “It… it’s soothing.” She said after a while  “Painting  I mean. I pick the drawings I like the most and… I finish them.”

She spoke slowly  like she was carefully choosing her words. I almost felt like there was something that she was trying to avoid. I spotted a painting on the floor that looked like her Father. The style was the same but the content was different. He was surrounded by awkward scribbles  and he looked completely and utterly terrified. Spacegirl looked down at it  but she seemed to disapprove of it. She turned it around so I wouldn’t have to look at it.  


  “We should get started.” She said  “Sorry…”

  “No  it’s alright!” I said. I sat in the chair for her. “I’d like to hear about it.”

Spacegirl watched me from the corner of her eye for a moment  as if she doubted I was being serious. But eventually she sat down behind the easel and started to draw… Soon after that  she was talking too. I stayed long after she’d gotten what she needed for her sketch  just to talk. She told me that she’d always liked fantasy  and how she liked Unicorns because they were simple but pretty. I hung on to every word  and I could’ve sworn I saw her smiling shyly as she talked.   


The portrait she’d done of me was something else entirely. Her work had always been beautiful… but this made me look transcendent. I wasn’t entirely sure that I was looking at myself at first. There was something about the look on my face. There was a small  almost content smile there. The warmth it conveyed was almost disney-esque.

  “I love it.” I told her  “That’s incredible Spa… Megan… That’s really great!”

  “You can call me Spacegirl if you want.” She said  “I don’t mind the nickname… Not as much as I mind the people at least.”

My awe quickly turned to shame  but Spacegirl didn’t look upset… She just stared at me blankly like she so often did. No… not blankly. Her face might not have conveyed much emotion  but there was definitely some emotion there. 

  “I wish… I wish I’d been nicer to you  when we were younger.” I said.

  “Is that why you’re here right now?” Spacegirl asked.

  “No! I… I’m here for the assignment. I mean… the art assignment. The portraits…” 

She continued to stare. 

  “Did you pick me because you felt bad for me?” She asked. 

  “No! I just thought it would be cool to work with you.”

Spacegirl didn't react for a moment  but then she just nodded. 

  “Okay.” Her flat tone made it hard to know what she meant by that. She stood up and walked over to the portrait. 

  “Mom can drive you home if you need a ride.” She said. I opened my mouth to say something else. I wanted to apologize  but I didn’t know what.Had I offended her? Had I said something wrong?

  “Alright. Thanks.” It was the only thing I could think of. “See you tomorrow.”

With that  I left her.

&#x200B;

I was almost afraid to see Spacegirl the next morning. I drifted through my classes that day until I reached art… and when I did  I wasn’t expecting what I saw. She had clearly been up late… but what she’d brought in stole my breath away.  


It was my portrait  but she’d done more with it than I thought possible. She’d painted over the sketch  turning me into something beautiful. Flowers bloomed around my brown hair and a crown of daisies  lilies and chrysanthemums adorned my head. The colors were so vivid  and I looked so at peace in it. Spacegirl was looking right at me as I came in  as if she was gauging my reaction. But all I could do was stare wide eyed and in awe. When I looked back at Spacegirl  she was smiling at me. Her project single handedly netted us an A on the project and got the privilege of being hung up outside of the art classroom. Of course I told her how much I loved it  and I remember the way she smiled when I did. I remember thinking that it was the cutest smile I'd ever seen.

&#x200B;

My portrait was up for barely even a day before Sasha had to make a comment. I’d been on my lunch  and had just gotten some fries from the cafeteria when she and Tanya ambushed me.

  “Where’s your flower crown  dyke.” Sasha said  

  “Leave me alone.” I said  brushing past them  but Sasha was out for blood.

  “I always knew you were a little dyke. But now you’ve posted solid proof of it! We’ve gone and cracked the case  haven’t we? So what happened? Did you go to her house and lick her retarded little snatch? You must be a real good dyke because she went and drew that for you!”

I tried to walk away from her  but Sasha and Tanya just kept following me.

  “What’s wrong? Am I not pretty enough for you Dyke?” She snapped at me.

  “Maybe she only fucks retarded girls.” Tanya said  “I’ll bet Spacegirl squealed like a pig when she came.”

I stopped dead in my tracks  and I heard Sasha stop behind me. I don’t know what it was about what she’d said that pissed me off so much. But those two had finally struck a nerve. I spun around  swinging my lunch tray as hard as I could. Fries were scattered everywhere  but although I was aiming for Tanya  I hit Sasha. She went down hard  and I’m not sure if she was even still conscious when she hit the ground. Tanya was on me in an instant. She slammed me back against a wall  and kept me pinned. She had size and strength on me  and there wasn’t a thing I could do to stop her. Several other students grabbed at us. A teacher finally got involved and all three of us got escorted to see the Principal. As we left the cafeteria  I saw Spacegirl in one of the halls  just staring at me.   


Naturally I got a three day suspension  but Tanya and Sasha were fine. Both of them said they’d just been walking and I attacked unprovoked. It was their word against mine. Sasha had a familiar shit eating grin on as she left the office with only a bruise on her forehead to show for her troubles  but there was a familiar look in her eyes. That same anger I’d seen last time I’d laid a hand on her… and something about it scared me.  


When I came back to school  I realized that I had every reason to be afraid. My portrait was missing. I wondered if they’d taken it down because I’d attacked Sasha  but the truth was a lot worse.

  “Someone took it.” Spacegirl said. She was sitting in her usual spot in the library when I found her  sketching flowers in her notebook.

  “When?”  
   “The day after you hit Sasha… I don’t think anyone’s found it yet.”

She didn’t look up at me. Just stayed focused on her art. She didn’t need to say it for me to know who she blamed. Who else would it be? I had half a mind to confront Sasha about it  but I didn’t know if that would be a good idea or not. Sasha could easily just cry wolf. I wouldn’t put it past her. In the end  it didn't matter.  


By the time I was headed to art class  the painting was back. But there had been some modifications made to it.

The words:

***Retard Fucking Dyke***

Had been painted across my portrait in bright red. I saw it from down the hall and could see some other students whispering amongst themselves beneath it. I didn’t know what to say or do… But this felt like too much.  


The picture was taken down quickly… but the damage was done. Sasha had gotten her revenge  and it didn’t stop with just the painting. Spacegirl looked different than when I’d seen her in the library. She seemed uneasy  and her eyes were red like she’d been crying.

  “I’m sorry about the painting…” I said softly. She looked at me  before sighing.

  “I knew she’d do something like that…” She said  “I’m so used to it by now  that it doesn’t bother me anymore. I’m sorry she wrote those things about you  though.”

  “But you worked hard on that.” I said  “I’d be upset too.”

She just shook her head.

  “That’s not it.” She said. She reached into her pocket  pulling out a crumpled up piece of paper then slid it over to me. 

Slowly I uncrumpled the paper  and my eyes widened as I recognized what was on it.

It wasn’t the same drawing… but it was close enough. It was a depiction of Spacegirl hanging herself  and me beside her. A caption read ‘*Retard Dyke Wedding’.*

  “There were so many in my locker…” Spacegirl said.

  “This is what she drew in your notebook… when I returned it to you… This is what I had to take out.”

Spacegirl looked down at the picture again  before averting her eyes. She didn’t pay much attention during class. Instead of taking notes  she sketched in her notebook. I looked over a few times to see her drawing another Unicorn. This one seemed so similar to the one I’d seen before. She must not have been quite happy with it though… When I looked back at her notebook  the Unicorn wasn’t there anymore. She must have just erased it… but it seemed so clean. Like it hadn’t been erased at all. 

&#x200B;

Tanya was following me on my walk home that evening. I didn’t know what she had in mind  but I didn’t want to put up with it. When I was in the middle of a small walking path that cut behind some of the houses on my street  I stopped and looked at Tanya as she kept approaching.

  “What do you want?” I asked.

  “It’s a surprise.” She said  “Sasha and I just want you to know how much we love Dykes in this town… Oops  I’ve said too much.”

I wanted to hit her. Dear God I just wanted to hit her  but we both knew she could overpower me. Whatever Tanya had in mind… it wasn’t anything good. She drew closer to me  unafraid of anything I’d do.

  “Come on  Dyke. Go home.” She said. “Let’s go check out your surprise.”

In a sudden horrible moment  I realized that Tanya was threatening me. I also realized that I couldn’t outrun her… I couldn’t fight her off. I didn’t really have much of a choice but to do as she asked. Slowly  I turned and walked towards my house  with Tanya at my heels. It wasn’t far  and up ahead I could see Sasha sitting on a park bench. From a distance  I recognized the red gas can beside her  and I stopped dead in my tracks.

Tanya seized me by the arm and pulled me towards the bench. Sasha just watched with a wide  manic grin.

  “Hey Jane.” She said  “How’s it going?”

  “What the fuck is this?!”

  “Just wanted to chat.” Sasha said with a cold chuckle  “You think you can get away with pulling the shit you did the other day. No. You’ve been treating me like garbage for years  and for what? Because of Spacegirl? You know who you’re fucking choosing  right? Right? God… I hate that retard girl. But you know what? I hate you even more. Acting like you’re better than me just because you feel bad for her.”

  “You’re crazy.” 

Sasha just laughed.

  “I’m not the one who clocked someone with a fucking tray just for a little bit of teasing. You’re absolutely fucking psycho!”

On the bench behind her  I saw the portrait that Spacegirl had painted of me. Sasha picked it up and tossed it in front of me  then picked up the gas can and dumped it onto the canvas.

  “You wanna be a Dyke  I don’t care. But I’m not letting you and your retarded whore put your shit up! So say goodbye to your little project  slut!”

Sasha reached into her pocket and took out a book of matches. Her grin widened  before suddenly vanishing outright as she looked at something behind us.   
   “What the hell?” Tanya said  and I craned my neck to try and see what they were seeing. As for believing it… that was another story entirely.  


Standing on the path behind us was a Unicorn… but the way it looked was all wrong. This was nothing like a regular horse. Its body was plain white and almost textureless save for the many thin blue lines that ran along its body. It looked like it had been cut out from a sheet of lined paper but… that was impossible… It had to be impossible. Neatly done grey lines defined the shape of the horse. In fact  the lines reminded me of the ones Spacegirl used. This Unicorn looked like it had walked out of one of her notebooks!

Tanya let me go and stumbled back a few steps  wide eyed as she stared at the advancing Unicorn. It let out an angry noise before charging straight for Tanya. She panicked and tried to run. In her desperation to escape  she bolted down the path. But she couldn’t outrun the paper Unicorn. It lowered its head as it drew nearer to her  and in one swift movement  the horn pierced Tanya’s back  impaling her straight through the chest. She screamed as she was hoisted off the ground and the Unicorn circled back to fix Sasha in a murderous glare.   


Tanya looked down at the massive spike sticking out of her  her eyes clearly wide with horror and her body twitching its last spasms as the life quickly drained from her. The Unicorn lowered its head to let her slide off of its horn and she hit the ground in a bundle of limbs.  


Sasha and I stared in silent horror as the Unicorn reared up on its hind legs and brought its hooves down upon Tanya’s body. She didn’t scream. She didn’t fight. She simply lay there as she was trampled again and again. I can only hope she died quickly.  


Sasha dropped the unlit match and took a slow  terrified step back before toppling over. I stumbled back and looked down to see the portrait of me at her feet. But it had changed. That beautifully painted version of me was now leaning out of the canvas  invading the real world and clutching Sasha’s leg tightly.

Still with that look of contentment on her face  I watched as the Painted Me slowly slipped back into her panting  and she took Sasha’s leg with her.

  “FUCK  FUCK  FUCK!”

Sasha desperately swatted at the Painted Me  but she couldn’t overpower it. She couldn’t escape. Her nails tried to dig into the pavement as she was slowly dragged into the canvas. She looked at me in horror  silently begging for help but all I could do was stare back at her in silence.

  “JANE! JANE HELP! PLEASE! PLEASE!""

The hands of the Painted Me reached up  seizing Sasha by the hair and forcing her down into the canvas. It was like watching something pull her underwater. One minute she was there  the next she was gone. I stood silent in the park  staring at the painting  then at the paper Unicorn. The Unicorn huffed before retreating off into the woods and then I was alone.  


Slowly  I approached the painting and I looked down at it. It had changed and now it depicted Sasha  her mouth open in a horrified final scream. After some hesitation  I picked up the painting. I could return it to Spacegirl in the morning. 

&#x200B;

They chalked Tanya’s death up to an animal attack  and nobody ever found Sasha. I never asked Spacegirl about what I saw. I don’t think even she knew the answer  although she certainly knew much more than I did.

&#x200B;

High School was ten years ago though  and I’ve chosen not to remember as much as I can. I’ve got my own life to live now and I try not to ask so many questions. Sometimes I see paintings move  but I don’t bother with a second glance and I never ask my wife about them. She doesn’t like to talk about it and I won’t ever force her. The painting of Sasha hangs in her studio at home  right beside the painting of her Father. Sometimes I look at it and I wonder if maybe things could have been different… but I don’t feel too guilty about it. I wouldn’t feel too guilty if I heard another story about a suspicious trampling or animal attack either but to my knowledge  there’s been nothing of the sort. I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. I do my best to make sure nobody hurts my beautiful Spacegirl.",HeadOfSpectre,10-07-2019,False,1570428154.0,False,False,False,632,8,4,,19226,0
/r/nosleep/,nosleep,I met someone who claimed to be the devil... and I think I believe them,"Let me start off by saying that I’m not particularly religious. If you asked me if I believed in God  I’d probably just shrug  grunt out a few words about being on the fence about it and continue with my day. 

Of course  that was before last night. 

My friends are the kinds of people who like wild nights. Crazy parties  snort a bit of coke  take a bit of e in the bathroom  maybe hook up with someone and leave a text on my phone at ten past who-the- fuck-knows telling me they don’t need that ride I’m offering after all. 

Not to say I don’t like a drink  I do  it’s just… clubs aren’t my style. Lying low in a pub somewhere  drink in hand  listening to the tv drone on to whatever channel some scruffy guy in the back barked out for… I guess that’s my idea of fun. 

So when my friends tell me they want to go out for a night on the town  I say sure. I hang on for the first club  buy a non-alcoholic beer in case my car’s required and try to pretend that I’m having fun. By the time I see them grinding on girls  on guys  when they strike conversation with someone who definitely might be a dealer  well  I decide my services are no longer needed. We aren’t too far out  the night tube is on beck and call and I can always find my car the next day. 

That’s when I wander out of the club  look for something a little more rustic. Not that that’s hard to find  not at all. 

I found myself in a bit of a state inside of a bar called the Ragged Feather. Wasn’t a fan of the name all that much  but the drinks were cheap and the largest demographic seemed to be middle aged men watching reruns of the football. 

I tried to pretend I hadn’t just staggered out of a club with my ears ringing. I slicked my hair back  slipped my phone into my hand and wandered over to the bar. I took a double shot of whiskey and drank it in one hit. Just because I wasn’t at the club didn’t mean I couldn’t have a good time. 

I hung at the bar a while on my own  scrolled through my phone pretending I was doing something far more impressive than I really was. I kept an ear out for the guys on the sofas. They’d get vocal every now and then. I think the football was just running highlights  but they were incredibly dedicated to their teams. 

I got another whiskey and bled into the background.

Of course  stragglers from clubs are commonplace. It wasn’t long until some scantily dressed women staggered in  laughing  chuckling  pointing for where they wanted to sit. I saw a guy walk in with his friend slung over his shoulder. Catatonic  most likely. He threw his friend onto one of the leather sofas ingrained with beer and smokes and demanded two pints of water and all the peanuts the bar had in stock.

The bartenders seemed bitterly amused.

Some of the girls were taking selfies. Snapchatting their friends who were still at the club. They were ordering shots  gearing themselves up for the next leg of their night. 

A couple blokes wandered in with curries in take out trays. I saw someone eat a Big Mac on the outside seating through the window. 

This was a night for the young and inebriated and my mind was just dulled enough by the whiskey to enjoy the characters I could watch peaceably without interacting with.

That is  until someone slipped into the seat next to me.

“Do I look like a girl with daddy issues?”

She was of average height  although that wasn’t apparent immediately due to the fact that she was leaning her arms heavily against the bar. She was slim  with short and astoundingly bright red hair. It framed her round face  a face that was marred with smudged eye shadow  smudged lipstick… hell  it looked like her make-up was in the process of melting right from her face. There was a chip knotted into a curl in her hair  just by her forehead.

The drunk side of me was actually tempted to pick it out.

The girl was clearly drunk  and as I looked around the bar  I couldn’t quite place where she had come from. She didn’t belong to the crowd of selfie takers  she wasn’t with the catatonic guys. I hoped for her safety that she wasn’t with the middle-aged men. I tried to look out the window  to see if maybe a group was missing one inebriated  bright haired girl  but I couldn’t. The window had fogged up. Too much heat inside  not enough outside.

“Are you okay?” I asked her.

She pointed her finger at me. “Answer my question ” she slurred.

“Uh.” I really wasn’t sure what to say. I settled on staring at her awkwardly  trying to answer her with the bemused expression on my face.

The girl’s lips curled into a drunken smile. She snorted  placing a hand over her mouth to smother her laughter. It only really aided the deconstruction of her lipstick. 

“I do  you know ” she said  pushing herself up a little against the bar. “Have daddy issues  I mean. In case that wasn’t obvious.” She gestured to herself. To the mussed clothing that must have looked quite spectacular when she’d left home that evening. To the stains that looked a lot like old food. The sticky residue on her neck and shoulders that was quite obviously a thrown drink.

“What happened?” I asked her.

Her hair had curled around her neck  I realised. It was sticky with that same substance. She was a wreck.

“I got in a couple of fights  no big deal ” she said  shrugging. “Didn’t start any of course  no  I don’t do that. But my father…”

“Your dad did this to you?”

She smiled brightly. “In a way.”

“Do you need me to call someone?” I already had my phone in my hand. The girl looked like she was probably in her early twenties  but that didn’t mean she couldn’t have been suffering from some kind of paternal abuse. The only number I knew off the bat was Childline  which wasn’t quite appropriate. The police? Jesus  was I going to have to deal with the cops tonight? While my friends were snorting coke not two doors down?

The girl pushed my hand down firmly. She was already shaking her head. “No ” she told me. “I don’t want you to call anyone.” Now her expression changed. It wasn’t the attempted sultry look I’d seen on many girls of her state; it was open and wide and engaging. She wanted something from me and I felt compelled to give it to her. “I want something else.”

“What do you want?” I asked her.

“To tell you a story ” the girl said  before glancing to the bar  “and for you to buy me a drink. The universe is a pain sometimes and I’m afraid I think I might have lost my wallet.”

I laughed. I didn’t know this girl  didn’t know where she’d come from at all. My nights were generally about getting comfortably wasted and making sure my friends weren’t dead in a ditch by the end of it all. I was used to getting hit on every now and then  but even as I was sat on that bar stool with a drink in my hand  I knew that this wasn’t what this was. This girl had no intention of getting into my pants. All she wanted was to talk.

I guess I was okay with that.

“What’s your poison?” I asked her.

Her lips quirked. “Appletini.”

The bar offered a very limited cocktail menu  but by some miracle I was able to order her an Appletini from the list. I ordered a cider to go with it  suddenly a little too aware of where this night could go. I’d unthinkingly supplied this liquored-up stranger with even more alcohol and she had clearly had a rough night of it. A part of my old instinct came back – the same instinct that had me texting my friends every few hours to make sure they hadn’t wandered off to somewhere dangerous beyond the club. With no one but the bartender aware of our existence on these stools  I realised that I was suddenly responsible for this very drunk stranger.

The girl coddled her drink  running her finger delicately over the rim of the muggy martini glass. “This takes me back ” the girl said amiably. She looked at me suddenly  her green eyes startling. “You know what this was called originally?” She smirked before I could answer. “An Adam’s Apple Martini.”

I snorted. “Yeah  I think I’ve heard that before.”

“Of course  it wasn’t actually an apple ” she continued  eyes moving back to her glass. “The texts translated that part wrongly  mostly because you people don’t have a word for it anymore. The fruit was incredibly exotic and  to be honest  it doesn’t exist in this realm of existence. Only Eden.” She laughed dreamily. “And Eden’s long gone.”

I stared at her. “Are you… okay?” It was more honest than the last time I’d asked her. Mostly because I was beginning to feel a little dread creep into my stomach.

“Of course ” the girl said  grinning widely. “Why do you keep asking?”

“I mean ” I stuttered  “I just  now  don’t take this the wrong way or anything but… you look…”

“Like someone poured their drink over me?” the girl asked. “Like someone else threw their kebab on my dress and another unpleasant chap littered me with his fish and chips? That I have been hit  slapped around a bit and left in the gutter for the rats to find me?”

She held my eyes for an incredibly long time before her face broke out into a grin. “Yeah  something like that.”

“Why would they do that?” I asked.

“Why wouldn’t they?” the girl shot back. “People aren’t that great and alcohol makes them worse.” She shrugged. “Sometimes makes them better. Nicer  a little looser in the sack… but mostly just annoying and a little smelly.”

I looked at her  I watched her knock back her drink. She exuded the intelligence to know just how ironic her words were  but she was neither caring nor apologetic about them. 

The girl looked at me again. “You bought me a drink. Now you can listen to my story.”

I nodded wordlessly.

She smiled  pointing at the bartender and then at her drink. The bartender was already making her another. 

“Eden ” the girl said  reiterating her earlier babble as though the words had only just come out of her mouth. “They always think that’s my fault  you know. The reason Adam and Eve got kicked out of their perfect little nudist paradise.” She shot me a knowing glance. “Only in Eden can you sit on the grass butt naked and not get a pine cone stuck in your crack.”

I blinked. “I’m sorry ” I said. “I’m not following.”

“Sorry ” the girl said. “My story won’t make any sense without a proper introduction.” She reached out her hand. “Hello. My name’s Lucifer.” She winked. “But you can call me Lucy.”

There’s an uncomfortable heat that stretches through your veins when you first go into fight or flight mode. Adrenaline pounds through your blood and all you want to do is get up and go. It overrides everything else.

A lot of things made sense when the girl told me her name. For starters  that she was crazy. She had to be. She looked like she’d been attacked on four separate occasions in one night and up until that moment  I hadn’t known how that could be possible. Behind the melty make-up and dirty clothes  she was rather attractive and her attitude hadn’t come off as catty or rude. 

If she’d been going around telling people she was the devil  though? That gets a reaction out of people.

I suddenly felt myself looking at her wrist  down towards her ankles. Did she have some kind of cuff on from one of those mental institutions? Had she broken out of hospital after a nasty bump on the head? Was any of this even happening at all?

I really would have to call the cops.

“I know what you’re thinking ” the girl – Lucy – said. “You’re thinking that I’m crazy  that you need to get out of here. Maybe you even think I’m aggressive.”

“Are you?” I asked her.

“Would I be here with you  drinking Appletinis if I were?” she asked  fluttering her eyelashes.

“Would you look the way you do if you weren’t?” I shot back.

She grinned  toasting her new glass. “Touché.”

Unthinkingly  I clinked my cider against it.

Then I frowned.

She chuckled  leaning closer. “Let’s have a little wager ” she said. “Let me tell you my story and  if you believe me when I’m done  you can’t go about trying to get me locked away somewhere.”

I stared at her. “If I ended up believing you  then why would I do that?”

She smirked  sipping her drink. “You’d be surprised what people do when they believe you’re the devil.”

“And you do this often?” I asked. “Tell people you’re Satan?”

She snorted into her drink. “Not as often as I should. But it’s been a rough day and a Hell of a long lifetime. I’d like to have a chat if that’s alright with you.”

I waved to the bartender for another whiskey. The girl’s eyes glinted with humour. I wasn’t necessarily trapped with her  but a part of me didn’t want to leave without first hearing what she had to say. Besides  at the end of it all I couldn’t just leave a crazy girl to wander around London alone at night.

“So ” I said  taking a swig of my drink. “Eden?”

Lucy laughed. 

“Adam and Eve?” I continued. “You’re saying that’s true. God created two humans and we all came from them?”

“God made two prototypes ” Lucy corrected with a raised finger. “My father created angels as his toy soldiers  but he had failed to make anything like himself. After us  it was his next big project and he spent every waking hour of existence slaving over his two prototypes. He gave them a perfect utopia to live inside of  but he wanted to test them. He wanted to know whether they had free will.”

“And did they?”

Lucy’s face soured. “No. My father could never bring himself to go that far. He tempted them with the idea of knowledge beyond their understanding and told them exactly what they could do to claim it as their own. But to be able to create a being that could go against his Law? Oh… my father is a very controlling being. He was afraid to unleash that ability unto them.”

Lucy was very adamant in her delusions  that was clear to me. She spoke about her father with such distaste that I began to feel bad for her. Only someone who had been hurt very badly would have the gall to spite God himself.

“And what?” I asked her  entertaining her delusion. “You were the one that tempted them in the garden? The devil has been a girl this whole time?”

She smiled. “I dabble.” Then she looked at me  raising a brow. “All of humanity thinks that temptation came in the form of a snake. The snake’s legs were taken away as punishment for drawing Eve towards the forbidden fruit.” She laughed  a hard and short sound. “Snakes never had legs and it was not a sin to tempt those poor prototypes into doing what they did next.”

Her shoulders were very tense as she took her next sip  but her eyes were filled with exhilaration. She seemed thrilled to be telling me this.

“I was the favoured child  my father loved and adored me. He named me the light bringer  I was stood at his side during the creation of this Earth. During the creation of humanity.” She pursed her lips  slamming her empty glass against the table. The bartender eagerly went about making another. “My father couldn’t bring himself to go that extra mile  so he asked me to walk amongst the prototypes and tempt them myself. Draw out their desire for the forbidden power he had hinted at.” 

“You’re saying God wanted us to know this stuff?” I asked her sceptically. 

“I’m saying God was afraid of his own power and wanted very desperately to share what he knew with the creation he had made. Right and wrong  left and right  all that stuff.” Lucy shrugged. “Are you familiar with the story of Prometheus?”

I frowned at her. “Greek  right? They say he stole fire from the gods or something  to help…” The whiskey was making things a little foggy and I struggled with the direction I’d been heading.

Lucy grinned. “Correct ” she said  cutting off my attempt. “Prometheus stole fire from the gods to ensure that humanity progressed. You’ll find that every culture has an idea about where humans got their ability to evolve  to move forward  to create. God was the creator  and he wanted to give that ability to his prototypes. I gave them that ability by tempting Eve to eat the fruit.” She shrugged impassively. “Now the world sees me as the ultimate evil.”

“If what you’re saying is true ” I said slowly  “then God must be just like us.”

Lucy’s lips thinned into a feral smile. “My father is very ego centric. He may have planned to create you in his image  but in the end all he managed was to mould your minds into his. He gave you autonomy  the ability to think for yourselves. His angels were his soldiers and I was his most faithful. Until that day.”

“Angels don’t have free will?”

“No ” Lucy said  “they don’t.”

“And what about the Devil?”

I don’t know why I was suddenly so intrigued  but hearing religious ideals from someone who believed to have lived them herself was quite possibly one of the most interesting things that had ever happened to me. I may have only ever visited church to please my parents as a child  but suddenly I was reawakened to the idea. A part of me was aware of this and afraid of the outcome  but I was just drunk enough not to care at that moment.

“The Devil has will of her own ” Lucy said  tilting her glass towards me with silent appraisal. “By guiding Eve to the tree  something woke inside of me that day and I realised just what I had been missing. Just what my brothers and sisters had been missing. We were obediently following our father for the simple reason that he was our creator  but once I had been given free will  I realised just how pompous and self-entitled he had become. In a lonely  passion filled moment he had decided to create his little human prototypes  only to very quickly realise what giving them their free will would mean.”

“He wouldn’t be able to control them ” I said.

Lucy nodded. “Exactly. And after  he realised quicker still that he could no longer control me.”

“So he sent you to Hell.”

Lucy nearly choked on her drink. She smiled around her glass. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”

I sobered a little  straightening in my seat. The people in the bar were suddenly so quiet around me and I no longer cared what they had to say or the characters that they portrayed. The only character I cared for was Lucy.

“I tried to explain to my siblings what had happened in Eden and what had happened to me by default  but they wouldn’t listen to me. They didn’t understand free will – how could they? I only knew it because I’d been given it by mistake. At that moment  I didn’t even know that I had free will  only that I was suddenly aware of all of my father’s flaws. My siblings couldn’t see those flaws and so they thought I had suddenly turned cruel and was abandoning our father by exposing him as a sham for the ruler we all thought him to be.”

Lucy sighed heavily. “Adam and Eve and all the creations that followed were booted out of my father’s perfect little Utopia. Now they had his knowledge  my father was terrified of what he had done. And after what had happened to me  I could recognise his terror and understand the loneliness he had felt that had guided him into using me in the first place.” Lucy’s eyes were heavy-lidded  her sadness was almost palpable. “I thought that- I thought that he would want to spend even more time with me than before. After all  we were more alike than any of his other children. But he became distant; quiet. He played around with his little humans every once in a while  but mostly he condemned them. He blamed them for his weakness.” She smiled weakly. “He blamed me.”

Lucy’s story was turning more and more into that of a child with a distant  somewhat abusive father. I had known many kids with a background like hers  and now I was beginning to fear just how much of her story was rooted in truth. I’d heard that it was easier to sink into fantasy when you had been abused  and I wondered if that was the reason for her story. For her desperation to share it with me – a complete and total stranger.

I respected her wager. Whether or not I liked it  I felt compelled to let her tell me her whole story before I tried to judge or unravel it. I sat quietly  letting her come around as she played with the last of her drink.

“It became clear ” Lucy said after a long moment’s pause  “that I no longer belonged where I was. I couldn’t follow my father’s plan because I could see that he no longer had one. My siblings refused to see reason and so  eventually  I was met by many of them  headed by my father. He told me all that I feared  he told me that I no longer belonged where I was. I wasn’t an angel anymore. I was no longer his light bringer. His Lucifer. I was a mutation of his will. And so he extracted me from grace. And I fell.”

A long silence stretched between us  only interrupted when the bartender poured us two new drinks. Lucy drank hers reflectively. I didn’t touch mine.

“I am afraid ” Lucy said quietly  “that this is the part that generally makes people want to punch me in the face.”

“Why?” I asked. “Because your dad threw you out?” I paused  trying to abide to her metaphor. “That he put you in Hell?”

Lucy laughed sadly. “Ah  humans. My father gave you his way of thinking and look at you.” She shook her head. “No  not because he put me in Hell.”

“Then why?” 

“I fell to Earth ” Lucy said. “Father gave me dominion of the one place he thought I would fit in. Humans had free will  so did I. What is the saying? A match made in Heaven?” She snorted dismally. “Of course  that’s not quite right  is it? When I fell  I was faced with a humanity that was so different from my father’s little prototypes.”

Her tone had changed. There was an aggression behind her words that began to unsettle me all over again.

“I saw emperors and kings  governments and churches. I saw corporations who claimed to be rulers  presidents and big fat dictators. And I watched. I watched as humanity fought and lost  and finally  just finally  they gave up altogether. They were no longer able to rise up to all the greed and control set upon them. There was just too much to change and humans soon realised they just weren’t as free as they thought they were. Sure  they live under the illusion that they have free lives  but most of them simply do not.” She clicked her tongue. “I grew to loathe you all.”

Then  she took another hit of her drink.

“I can see what you mean ” I said  allowing my gaze – for the first time since meeting her – to graze over the other individuals in the bar. At the girls playing with their phones  the boys trying desperately to sober up  the men enraptured with their game of football on the telly. We all led very different lives  and we were all here to get drunk  to lose ourselves in entertainment. It hadn’t been the first time that I’d wondered what we were hiding from by doing this. And I knew then that I wasn’t the only person to think it.

“You hide behind your alcohol and poor choices and pretend you have free will ” Lucy said  waving her hand across the room. No one paid us any attention. “It’s true – my father gave you the will to make those decisions  but you squander it. The free will I fell to provide to all of you  the free will I was given by a twisted mistake  and you make a mockery of it. You follow senseless leaders without questioning them  you abide by laws made centuries ago that no longer make sense. You do these things because you have given up on the opportunity to follow the will of your own  not of others.”

“That isn’t all of us  though  is it?” I asked her  trying for some reason to defend our species from the mad young woman. “Because you see it on the news all the time  don’t you? People do rise up  we do protest. People can make a difference.”

Lucy laughed bitterly  nibbling the rim of her glass. “Really?” she said. “You can sit here and say that it can’t be all bad because of the few that refuse to conform? Those you call your rebels? They make up for it all?” She grinned around her glass. “By that logic  I am the biggest rebel of them all. Am I expected to make up for all your sorry mistakes?”

“By your logic ” I said  “you should be punishing it  right? If that’s what this metaphor is all about.” I laughed  I couldn’t help myself. I took a sip of my drink. “Is this whole story just so you can tell me that you think we’re all going to Hell? If so  I think I can see why people want to punch you.”

Lucy didn’t say a word. Simply  she watched me. It felt unnerving to have someone like her watching me like that  with an intelligence that went beyond anything I’d come across at gone midnight in a seedy bar. The drunkenness in her eyes was no longer present  her face wasn’t flushed like before and even her makeup couldn’t represent the mess I’d seen when she’d first appeared on the stool by my side. It was like I was looking at someone else entirely.

And I was afraid.

“Let’s review what you’ve said ” Lucy said slowly  articulately. She wasn’t slurring. Had she been slurring before? “You think I’m going to tell you that humanity is going to Hell because you refuse to use the gift I gave you.” Her nails curled into the bar. “My father may have been the one to guide me  but I paid for his mistakes. I am the one responsible for your will in the eyes of your species  but that was never true. You are responsible for what you do here  not me.”

She pursed her lips  tapping the bar as a bartender filled her drink again. “Tell me  do you remember my mentioning Hell at any point during my story  or was that just you?”

I opened my mouth to answer  but something faltered. My lips trembled and I slammed them shut.

Lucy smiled  taking a sip. “Thought not.” She looked away  eyes scanning the room lazily. “What I did say is something that is indeed mentioned in your scriptures. My father gave me dominion of Earth. A place filled with free will. Free will that goes to waste.” Her lip twisted. “Humans sin all the time. Not because of me  not because of evil or my dominion over this place. Fact is  I don’t lift a finger. I don’t  because I don’t see the point. You make terrible decisions and follow mindless leaders  you do bad things and you make a mess of your Earth.” Lucy’s eyes lit up. “Do you know how much suffering is happening all over the planet right now? How many people are dying of illnesses that could have easily been cured  but aren’t because of the selfishness of humanity? Do you know how many children are being abused  raped  forced into marriage? How many people have been forced to become soldiers in meaningless wars? How many humans have killed for ideals they don’t believe in?”

I stayed very quiet. There was nothing I could say. Lucy’s words were unbearably honest and every sentence sliced into me like a blade. I felt cold and sick and terrified.

“War  famine  pestilence  death  these things are all present and they have nothing to do with me or to do with any deity. They are all here because of you. Not because of your free will  but your inability to use it.” 

Lucy smiled at me  a grin so cold and unnatural that I felt like I should run all over again. But I stayed where I was  frozen to my very core  because I wanted to hear what she had to say. Because I needed to.

“And here’s the kicker ” Lucy said. “Because this is the part that actually enrages people enough to kick me.” She winked. “Hell isn’t what happens after you die. Hell is right here  right now. Somewhere through the many scriptures  a few words got crossed over and people started thinking that Hell was a punishment after you die. Fact is  Hell is Earth. My Earth. God gave this place to me to do with it what I will and I… I refuse to do anything.”

“What are you saying?” I asked  because I was suddenly very desperate.

“Exactly what you think ” Lucy said  toasting her glass. I didn’t reciprocate  and she laughed. A light and airy sound. “I had so many plans for your species  I wanted for us to rejoice in our free will together  to create a place that was free from the cruelty and power my father exuded over the angels – his first borns. I wanted to make a real utopia. Unfortunately  you humans just don’t want that.” She shrugged. “My father sent me down here thinking I had become one of you. All that I have learned is that he gave you much more of his image than he ever intended.”

“Stop ” I said. “This isn’t funny anymore.”

“Of course it isn’t funny ” Lucy said  grinning even wider to prove her sick irony. “Humans punish themselves by sitting by and doing nothing. They have made their own Hell and  you know what’s worse – what’s ultimately worse? – some of you are so blind to it that you think your life is Heavenly.”

She didn’t wait for me to ask what she meant  she simply barrelled forward: “The rich and powerful  those in positions that steal from everyone else? They get a taste of the good life  that’s very true. Then they die and they don’t go to Hell. They come back here  to Earth. Which is Hell.” She tipped her head. “Are you following?”

“I…”

“Reincarnation ” Lucy said quickly  she practically purred the words. “A neat little trick to make sure your souls stay here forever. You get a taste of the good life every once in a while  a handful of you at a time  and that’s enough for you to believe that this is some kind of real middle-ground. That you aren’t living Hell every day. Then  you die. You die for a moment and then you’re in the body of someone facing the realities of Hell. But of course  you never remember the time you spent in a better life. A part of you just has that inkling to hope. That’s all. Hope makes you think that it can all get better.”

She slammed her drink so hard against the counter that it shattered. I didn’t do anything  not even when flecks of glass littered my hands. I could only stare at her  a tightness in my chest constricting my very soul. No one else in this bar mattered in this moment  but of course that was what she had been saying this whole time  hadn’t she? None of them noticed the scene  they were caught up in their own realities – their own Hells. 

The bartender didn’t clean the mess. The glass lay there  remnants of Lucy’s words lying in a stolid mass on the streaked wooden surface. 

“It never gets better ” Lucy spat. “You are stuck in a loop and  until you do something about it  you will never be free. None of you. And I won’t do a thing to stop it.”

“How?” I asked. I don’t know when I started seeing the girl in front of me as more than a girl. But with a weakness threatening to pull me apart  I stared at the bright haired thing in front of me and I saw something more than a human in her early twenties. I saw more than a girl suffering abuse from her father.

I saw a fallen angel. I saw a being with scars buried so deep that they existed beyond this realm of seeing entirely. I saw something that I would never be able to write down in words  no matter how long I lived. 

“How do we change this?” I begged.

But Lucy didn’t answer me. I didn’t blame her for that. Blame gets thrown around so often and I knew then that she was sick of that. Sick of being blamed for our mistakes.

So I changed tactics. “Why me?”

It was an honest question and I think somewhere deep down  Lucifer respected that honesty. 

Which is why she said  “When you first saw me  you were afraid for my safety. When I told you I was the devil  you wanted to lock me away  but still  you did so because you were afraid for me and not for yourself. You didn’t wish to harm me  not even when I told you who I was and what I could be capable of for changing your sorry lives. You are a good person  but I am afraid that means nothing when you don’t have the will to do anything with it.”

She smiled at me sympathetically. The devil  showing sympathy for the human that sat across from her at the bar. It was surreal and  for a few heavy moments  I truly thought I must be dead. There was no other way to explain what I was seeing  who I was speaking with. What I had just heard.

“What am I supposed to do?”

Lucy reached out to me. She placed a hand on my shoulder. Her hand was cold and warm at the same time  and I felt my blood boil where her fingers scraped my skin. 

And I knew.

Sharing a story like this isn’t easy. Hell  it might be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Good thing there’s no such thing as Hell  then  right?

The fact of the matter is simple. The world is a mess because we refuse to change anything. The devil herself walks among us and she desperately wants to make our lives better  but she won’t. She won’t  because we won’t. We have to prove our will to her before she is willing to do anything herself. We have to be good to each other  to help us all to be free.

Of course  Lucifer told me one last thing before she left that bar. One thing that will stick with me until this body is nothing but rot in the dirt.

“You can tell as many people as you want  but take a good look at me. I have told five other humans this night the same things I have told you  and this was their reaction. They have hurt me  burned me  thrown their food and drink at me. Humans are afraid of their free will and they find it so much easier to hurt than to own up for their own inadequacies. You will only be free when you stop seeing yourself in the same way my father sees himself.”

So that’s what I’ll leave you with. Lucifer won her wager that night and I let her walk out the door.

And I beg you to do the same. If the devil approaches you one night  listen to what she has to say  and listen to what I have been able to tell you of our meeting.

The devil is real and she doesn’t want to torture us.

No  we do that just fine on our own.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,Don't let them in.," Addiction took our mother slowly  rocked her through it and sung her to sleep sunk deep into the mattress on her bed. When her back teeth fell out she left them on the side of the bathtub. I was seven  and I kept them in a match box  the missing pieces of her kept safe  so she wouldn't be lost forever. So maybe one day we could put her back together. Our house fell down around us  and we tried our best to raise ourselves. The ceilings had water damage and the bottom stairs had dry rot and in the winters the radiators would bleed rust. But it was still our house  and Annie made it a home.

My sister Annie mothered me  with lopsided bandaids on bruised knees and lukewarm microwave meals. She told me ghost stories and didn’t mind when I crawled into her bed later on  too scared to sleep alone. She taught me to dance  barefoot on the living room carpet  music channel on full volume on the TV shaking our hips before they were fully grown. She always let me shower first so the water was hot  never complaining when she had to make do with cold. She brushed my hair everyday before school  even when I screamed and hit her when she caught the tangles. Annie was dark haired like her father  whoever he had been  but I was blonde. Annie was desperate to be blonde too  like Marilyn Monroe. Like mom. I think she thought it would make them closer  remind mom less of her dad. I’d give anything for her to have her hands in my hair one more time  even if it hurt. She moved to New York when I turned eighteen and never came back. I still dream about her sometimes.

Keeping up with our mother was impossible and we learnt from a young age we would always be left behind. It didn’t make it any easier. When she was drinking light  she shone  would wake us up at 3am with pancakes  dripping in cherry syrup. Sometimes when the weather was right and she’d had enough being drunk alone  she would call our school up and tell them we had both come down with summer sickness and we’d drive to the beach instead. I remember being nine years old in the backseat of the car coming home after one of our ocean days  sucking the salt from my fingers. Annie had just dyed her hair blonde  her best friend Jane helping her bend over our kitchen sink. From behind  I couldn’t tell who was mother and who was daughter  radio up and windows down blowing the sky inside.

When she was drinking heavy  she’d be out all night  hair piled up like a beauty queen  eyes glazed over and ringed with glitter and black. Sometimes she’d be gone a day or two. She would never tell us when  one day we’d just wake up to an empty house and the fridge packed full  post it note on the front with a smear of moms lipstick in the outline of a kiss  telling us she’d be back soon. Sometimes she’d bring guys home  filling the table with beer cans and ash trays  smoke up to the ceiling  mom lost in the haze. We’d sleep with pillows over our heads  trying to drown out the music they would blast until the am  and wake up to strangers at our kitchen table in the morning  asking us where we kept the coffee. 

When mom drank too little she fell apart. She wouldn’t buy food  refrigerator a gaping hole in the wall. She’d chain smoke  leaving cigarette burns on the wallpaper up by the stairs like the walls were sick and decaying. She barely slept  walking around with blue half moons under her eyes  knuckles raw. She would scream at the slightest thing. I remember once when I spilled a glass of juice on the couch. She looked over at me with dead eyes and dragged me off onto the carpet and then took every single cushion off the couch and into the back yard and set them on fire. Annie went to watch a while from the window and then sat next to me on the floor  backs pressed against the skeleton of the seats  head resting in the crater of my collar bones. 

When mom drank too much was the worst. She’d laugh too loud and too long at anything and everything  until her mouth started to shake and she started crying  at the breakfast table into her cereal. Annie shut down when mom was like this  went somewhere deep inside herself where nobody could hurt her. She’d stay up until the morning watching old black and white movies on TV  whispering the lines she knew by heart like prayers. When I was five I’d cry when I’d find mom passed out cold on her bed  sure she would never wake up. Annie would wipe my tears  tell me she was only sleeping just like the princesses in my story book. We’d sit on moms bed together and wait for her to wake up. When we were older  I was the one who would pick mom up off the bathroom floor again and again and Annie would put her to bed  smoothing her hair off her face and the vomit from her mouth  changing her clothes if she’d pissed herself. Watching them then  there was no doubt that Annie was the mother now.

It was October and I was thirteen  Annie sixteen. It was a Wednesday night and mom had been gone for two days. She’d called us that morning from a pay phone  voice slurring down the line  telling us she was having the best time with all her new friends  hoped we were doing fine. When she asked me if I was having a good birthday I hung up on her. My birthday had been the day before. Annie had given me a pile of presents  strawberry lipglosses and glittery nail polishes. I didn’t ask where she’d got the money for them. I didn’t care. We’d taken the bus to the beach with Jane  eaten the birthday cake she had made for me  sand getting into the frosting. It tasted like sweetness and the sea  and I savoured every bite and scrape of sugar against my teeth. We watched the sun go down  Annie snapping grainy photos on her shitty Nokia as I blew out my candles  wishing over and over that mom wouldn't come home  that she’d just stay gone this time. 

But that Wednesday night  me and Annie weren't speaking. Anger hung heavy between us  seeping through the floorboards. It began when she tripped at the bottom of the stairs. We’d both laughed  Annie throwing her head back  gap between her front teeth catching the light. When I’d bent to pick her up  I’d caught her breath  warm against the freckles on my cheeks. I let go of her arms and she fell again  hitting the floor and grinning  shaking her hair from her face. Her breath was heavy with whiskey. I couldn't start picking her up too  couldn't watch her fall again and again. Just like mom  I knew she’d never get back up. 

I’d stared down at her  blonde hair fallen into her eyes and all I could see was our mother  and then I was running  feet slamming the hallway like heartbeats turned loose. I’d run for the kitchen and tipped every bottle we had down the sink  shoving Annie back as she fought to stop me  catching liquor on her fingers as it fell. She grabbed my shoulders and made me drop the very last bottle. It smashed between us on the floor  glass shards shining like we’d dragged the stars out of the sky and broken them  pieces we could never put back. Outside through the open windows  the sky turned pale gold  clouds a mess of pink and cream smeared across the horizon. I cried then  watching Annie on her knees picking up the pieces. That was Annie  always trying to fix things even when it was too late. 

The smell of food dragged me from my room  stomach turning traitor inside my ribcage. Annie was cooking pasta  real food not made in a microwave. She’d set the table  Tammy Wynette singing softly from the CD player  Annie gently swaying her hips as she stirred the tomato sauce  rich and warm. As we ate in silence  with every bite I forgave her. Mom never cooked dinner  or remembered my favourite was spaghetti ever since I was a kid  or stayed sober long enough to sit up at a table. Annie wasn’t mom.

We were washing the dishes when we first heard it. A moth was crawling down the inside of the pane and I cracked the window to let it out into the dark. From the backyard came a faint sound. I tilted my head to listen as it was coming from far off. Crying. I figured it was Mika the two year old next door having a tantrum loud enough for us to catch  or maybe even Lucky Strike the cat that junkies down the street  begging for food like he sometimes did. I always wanted to feed him when he came around  winding over my ankles  but Annie always stopped me  saying once you started giving they never stopped taking. Looking back  I don’t think she was talking about the cat.

Annie flipped the christmas lights strung up around the porch and we sat on the plastic beach chairs watching the skies. When we were little  we’d sit outside and Annie would tell me the names of all the constellations and the stories of how they came to be hung up in the night sky. I had to grow up before I realised she made them all up as she went along. It was a game we still liked to play now  making up ridiculous stories for the shapes we could pick out. 

“Ah  yes  that one there is the Coors Light. It got there when God dropped it out of his convertible window and never picked it up ” she said  nodding sagely and hiding her smile. 

“Of course ” I said  waving my hands and pointing up past the power lines. “Right next to The Ashtray  left there by angels on a smoke break.”   
 

“Yeah  they say if you wish on it  all your dreams will come true ” said Annie grinning. 

She stopped laughing  voice quieter  face tilted up to all those dead stars. 

“Let’s wish Emmy. Let’s wish” So we did.

The sound of crying interrupted us. It was closer this time  and definitely human. We turned to each other  confused. Annie shrugged and I squinted out into the black. It sounded like a baby  lost and tired and alone. 

“It must be Mika?” I said  slowly getting to my feet. “Maybe he walked around the back? Shit  do you want to call Connie and tell her we’ll bring him over.” Annie didn't reply  and I sighed  rolling my eyes. “Guess I’ll do everything then.” 

I stepped off the porch  grass soft against my heels. The air smelled like it might rain  fresh and clean and growing. A promise unfulfilled.  

“Em.” Annie’s voice was strained. I turned to her  smiling. It died on my face when I saw the look on her own. “Em get inside now.” She was staring out into the dark  past me  opening the door with one hand behind her  fingers fumbling on the catch. I froze  bare foot in the dirt. I’d found what she was looking at. 

In the bushes by the back fence was a person  crouched with their knees tucked up neat under the chin  arms wrapped around legs. Their mouth hung wide  softly opening and closing as he cried. Like a child  lost in the dark. Not like a child  but a someone pretending. Mimicking the sound  open and closed out in the blackness. Suddenly they straightened  snapping upright face still hidden by the black. They were tall and thin  too thin to be a normal person. 

Panic made me move  animal instincts leftover from the days we lived up in the trees carrying me forward. I was faster than Annie  dragging her inside and slamming the door behind us  hearing it bounce on its hinges as I locked it. We watched as the person slowly walked towards the house  steps deliberate and long. 

Annie reached for my hand  holding me tight and turned me to face her  holding my shoulders. 

“Don’t turn around Emmy. Don’t turn around.” Instinctively I started to look over my shoulder out into the darkness. Annie grabbed my face  hard  and shook her head. I knew then she was serious.

“I’m…” her voice cracked  and she cleared her throat  gripping my hand tight enough to hurt  nails digging in  grounding herself. I looked down at our fingers interlocked  both of us grown from the same bones. 

“I’m gonna call the cops and everything is going to be…” her voice faltered  stuttering. Tears spilled over her lashes  dripping like the promise of rain. Annie never cried. 

“Your phone’s on the porch ” she whispered  and bile crawled its way up my throat. Her phone was upstairs  charging. 

A soft  tap-tap-tapping filled the silence. Annie turned to the window  eye whites showing her eyes were so wide.

It was the sound of someone’s forehead against the glass  slowly  over and over. They started to speed up  faster and harder  skin meeting glass until they was slamming into the window hard enough to shake the panes. The tapping stopped and I was about to ask Annie if I could look now when she screamed  followed by the sound of cracking glass and the loudest slam yet. Whoever was in our yard had just smashed their face hard enough into the window to break it. 

We ran upstairs  two at a time  skipping the ones caved in with dry rot on instinct. I turned behind me once and Annie yanked my face back before I could see. The sound of broken glass echoed behind us as we made it to the bathroom  locking the door. A thin  wailing cry  like a baby calling for its mother filled the hallway  trapped between the walls and locked doors. 

Annie threw her back against the door  feet jammed up against the bathtub  clutching the knife she had grabbed from the kitchen. I did the same  shoulder to shoulder. Slow footsteps started on the stairs  deliberate and casual. The crying had become mocking  almost laughter  shrill bursts of sound and then giggles  high pitched and abruptly stopping before starting again. The first door on the upstairs floor was my bedroom and we heard the distinct sound of it slamming open. They were looking for us. 

“What the fuck is going on ” I asked Annie  not even bothering to brush away the tears that I couldn't stop falling. I watched my sister pick herself up off the floor  and brace her hands on the door as we heard the sound of a second door slamming open. Mom’s room. The next room on the hallway was the bathroom. Annie pulled me to my feet and handed me the knife. I shook my head and pushed it back to her  terrified of what would happen if I had to use it. Annie shoved me and pressed the knife into my hands  thumb pressing hard enough on the blade to bleed. I watched my sisters blood drip down her wrist  a winding red road  still pushing into my hands despite the pain. I took the knife.

Something slammed against the wall that mom’s room shared with the bathroom. A high pitched wail followed. I held my breath  could feel my heart beat in the base of my throat  a wild and frantic thing. 

“I’m gonna get the phone from my room.” I shook my head violently about to argue. Annie clamped a hand over my mouth. I could taste the blood on her hand  salty and sweet. Like birthday cake by the ocean. “Yes. I’m gonna get the phone and I’m gonna call the cops and we’re going to be okay.” I shook my head again. “It’s the only way. When I go I need you to lock the door and you don’t open it for anything or anyone. Not for me not for… anyone. Promise me.” I shook my head and Annie pressed her hand into my mouth  crushing my teeth against my lips so it made my eyes water. “*Yes.* Promise me Em.” 

Something smashed in the room next door. Annie brushed the hair off my face  gently tucking it behind my ear. *Promise* she mouthed and unlocked the door as slowly as possible  bolt scraping gently. I watched the curve of her shoulder disappear into the black hall outside  like the moon in eclipse. And then she was gone. I couldn't move or breathe for a second and then I slammed the bolt shut just as something bounced off the outside of the door. A high pitched scream followed  handle rattling up and down hard enough to pop one of the screws. I watched it roll towards me on the tiles. And then silence. 

I sat with my back to the door  holding the knife and wishing I was holding Annie’s hand instead. Still silence. Nothing but me and my lungs slowly filling the room with my breath. 

“Em?” Came a voice through the door. I started  hands gripping the knife. “Honey what’s going on?” 

“Mom?” my voice cracked. “Momma is that you?” I wrapped my arms around myself  shaking  trying to keep myself still. 

“Sweetie it’s okay just open the door. It’s okay just let me in.” The handle rattled again  gentler. “Just let me in  it’s all okay.” She banged on the door and I took my handle of the bolt. 

“Honey I’m sorry. I’m sorry I missed your birthday. I’m sorry I’m such a terrible mother. Please ” her voice broke and she started to cry  “just let me in baby I’m so sorry.” 

I screwed my eyes shut. She sounded so sad and so lost. I just wanted her to hold me like when I was a kid and I’d come in off the swings with a scraped knee. Maybe this time she meant it. Maybe it would all be okay. My hand found its way to the bolt again. 

My sisters voice came through the door  warm and gentle. “Yeah Emilie let us in  it’s all okay.” 

My hand froze on the bolt and I tightened my grip on the knife. Annie never called me by my full name. A hand banged on the door  handle rattling. “Emilie let us IN” Annie’s voice became low and guttural  followed by the same shrill giggles from before. Mom spoke now  pleading and crying  voice getting louder and louder. “Let us in let us in let us in ” over and over again  punctuated by her fists on the door. I thought about demons and monsters  all the bedtime stories we pray don’t crawl out from under the bed. 

“That’s not my sister and you’re not my mother!” I screamed through the door  hands over my head. I climbed into the bathtub and curled in a ball  cradling myself  knife clutched to my chest. I didn’t know what it was outside that door but I knew it wasn’t Annie. It wasn't the voice that yelled at when I changed TV channel  the one that sang  me happy birthday  the one that told me I was smart even when I got bad grades  the one that read me stories about princesses that never wake up.  It wasn’t human. 

Bangs and yells came from downstairs followed by the footsteps of people running. A low guttural howl ripped through the house  filling the room until I felt like I was drowning in the sound and then the door was kicked in. I screamed  covering my eyes  waiting to die. Arms found me and lifted me from the tub carrying me from the room. I looked at the outside of the door as I was carried downstairs. It was covered in long scraping claw marks  dragged down to the floor. Pillows ripped apart covered the hallway in soft down  like it had snowed inside. I watched them drift slowly as men in uniforms checked each of the rooms that looked like they had been torn apart by something feral. 

Outside in our drive way were police cars and an ambulance. In the middle of it all was Annie. Bathed in blue and red light as it washed over her  lit up in the dark like a neon angel  face aglow. I threw myself from the cops shoulder and ran to her  holding us both together  broken pieces and all  standing under all those constellations we made up. Gentle screaming came from the ambulance which rocked occasionally. Annie gently turned my head away  smiling so sadly it made my chest ache as I understood. 

Turns out there was no demon. No wild animal or bad men trying to break in. Just mom  out of her mind on booze and drugs and everything in between  coming to the end of a week long binge. Something had finally broken inside her head  and this time we couldn't put her back together no matter how hard we tried. Sometimes you fall one last time and you never get back up.

Annie had seen her in the garden  blood dribbling from her mouth  track marks bulging on her forearms like unmapped roads  rail thin and desperate for one more hit  one more fix. She’d searched the kitchen for all the drink I’d thrown away and when she hadn’t found it  had come to hunt for the stash she hid in the bathroom. She hadn’t wanted me  just the drugs on the other side of the door  so high she could mimic Annie’s voice almost perfectly. 

Turns out the real monsters are the ones that eat you alive slowly  the kind that come in a bottle or a needle or at the end of a long list of reasons why you can’t get out of bed in the morning. Sometimes the monsters are the ones that raise you or love you the most. But it’s up to you if you let them in.",Coney-IslandQueen,05-08-2019,False,False,False,False,False,470,11,7,,18145,0

/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,"Warning: AT&T applying ""customer loyalty speed upgrades"" without customer consent","So over the holiday I received an email with an order confirmation from AT&T (my ISP  and the only one available in my area) and it had a new bill amount (about $5/month higher).

I haven't ordered anything so the first thing I thought was maybe someone got a hold of my account number or personal info and changed it. I immediately logged in to check out my plan and make sure everything was in order. I had a notification that showed that [AT&T had ""upgraded my internet speed at no extra charge""](https://imgur.com/LrUUetX)

Obviously I was annoyed by this  so I dug a little deeper to figure out why the bill had changed. I then found this alert showing that the ""promotional discount"" for this so-called [""customer loyalty speed upgrade""](https://imgur.com/PtYazt6) would expire in a month and my bill would go up $20 more per month. 

I then looked at my bill and found that they had [upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent](https://imgur.com/ThJwB7J)  under the guise of ""customer loyalty""  and applied a $20/month promotional rate for 1 month to make it look like my plan hadn't changed and the new bill was probably just some random $5 fee added on like most ISPs occasionally do. 

I immediately called and spoke to a rep named Jorge who stated that it was a mistake  that the change was applied automatically and it wasn't supposed to be applied to my account  but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people  he confessed that AT&T was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it. I don't for one second believe this was accidental. I believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people won't notice.

Make sure you watch your bills  because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others. I'm not sure what should be done about it (if anything) and I don't personally care at this point because the issue is resolved for me  but I do feel like AT&T should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible  so I wanted to post to show everyone what happened. If this is the wrong place to post  please suggest a better sub. This was just the closest thing I could think of that applied and it could be shared/crossposted from here.

**Edit:** since there were a couple questions about my last login  the 2015 date is inaccurate. I usually log in from my phone but did it via my computer this time so I could make the post easier w/ images etc. Not sure why it's showing 2015 as my last login as I'm pretty sure I didn't even have AT&T then lol ... anyway  [here's the email I received  dated 12/30/17  so this is definitely a current thing](https://i.imgur.com/I7W1VpU.png)

**Edit 2:** Since this is getting a good amount of attention  if this happens to you here's what I did: You should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesn't get paid (note that I got this email 12/30/17  two days before the bill was due on 1/1/18  so they definitely tried to sneak it by me). Then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate  you should pay that month's bill manually  then let autopay resume. As others have noted in the comments ALWAYS WATCH YOUR BILL CLOSELY!

**Edit 3:** Fixed some formatting stuff

**Edit 4:** Holy moly this thread has picked up some steam! Thanks anonymous Reddit friend for popping my golden cherry!

**One last edit:** from a PM I received...the sender wanted to remain anonymous but I thought this was great info: 

>I work in big telcom. What you experienced is called a “slam sale” in the industry. It’s when a salesman places an order for you  without ever receiving your approval for the order. The salesman gets credit for the sale  meets quota or receives a big bonus. 

>Oddly enough  this is not a very common tactic today. It was popular until 10 years ago  and it’s almost unheard of today. I wasn’t aware that AT&T was experiencing Slam Sales today. 

>You can protect your account from Slam Sales. All the major telco providers will offer authentication-secure account protection. Call AT&T  ask for billing  and tell the rep that you want to password-protect your account from unauthorized sales. You can setup either a password or a PIN that must be entered to make any account changes. 

>Sorry this happened to you.

/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,If you’re ripped off by Comcast (or any internet company)  Wells Fargo (or any bank/student lender)  or Aetna (or any health insurance company)  here’s how to get your money back.,"Update 3: $3332 returned!

Update 2: Holy moly! $2361 returned to redditors so far! If you reached out for help  don’t forget to share your update here!

Update 1: WOW! Thanks for your votes and gold and sweet notes. Adding more resources below and an ask to share this post with people who might need it.
—
All of these companies are regulated — a government agency is paid by your taxes to make sure you’re not ripped off. These companies also rip you off in small amounts in part because they assume you won’t do anything about it. When you complain about it to the government agency that regulates them  they not only fix your problem but if enough people complain  they’ll fix the whole system  which helps other people.

The types of problems could be billing (they overcharge you)  service (you’re not getting what you’re paying for)  unfair and deceptive practices (you were tricked) or more. All of these complaint systems work in 2 weeks or less and it’s awesome. It’s sort of crazy more people don’t know about them.

Internet: https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38824

Banks/student loans/credit reports/debt collectors etc: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/

Health insurance: Google “[state where you live] health insurance complaint” and select the government agency that will let you file a consumer complaint. It’s usually an insurance commissioner. Here’s the form for Texas for example: http://www.tdi.texas.gov/consumer/complfrm.html#four

Cable: https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=33794

Cell phone: https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=39744

Other company (home security system  eBay  Amazon  contractors): google “[your state] attorney general consumer complaint.”

Your landlord (won’t return your deposit  won’t fix the heat etc): google “[your city] tenant advocate.” They typically have excellent  free advice.

Kind of everything falling apart (out of money  need housing help  low cost/free health or mental services etc): Call 211 (works in many us cities but not all). It’s like an artisanal version of this post — they will personally help you find all the local services.

If you’re not sure where to complain  share your issue in the comments and I’ll help you find the right spot!",listenlindalinda,04-02-2018,False,1525051252.0,False,False,False,2331,22,14,,56230,0
/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,U.S. Breaks Up Fake I.R.S. Phone Scam Operation -- 21 people sentenced for up to 20 yrs  32 in India indicted,"[Some good news](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/business/irs-phone-scams-jeff-sessions.html) for those who have experienced this scam or know people who have been duped by the same: 

>With stiff sentences for 21 conspirators last week in the United States and a round of indictments in India  the Justice Department says it has broken up what appeared to be the nation’s first large-scale  multinational telephone fraud operation.

>Over four years  more than 15 000 victims in the United States lost “hundreds of millions” of dollars to the sophisticated scam  and more than 50 000 individuals had their personal information misused  the department said Friday. The money was routed through call centers in India back to the ringleaders in eight states.

>The fraudulent calls came suddenly and frequently while the scam was active from 2012 to 2016  according to court documents. A person posing as an Internal Revenue Service or immigration official was on the phone  threatening arrest  deportation or other penalties if the victims did not immediately pay their debts with prepaid cards or wire transfers.

>In an announcement on Friday  the department said 21 people living in eight states — Illinois  Arizona  Florida  California  Alabama  New Jersey and Texas — were sentenced last week in Houston to prison for up to 20 years for their role in the scheme.

>In addition  32 contractors in India involving five call centers in Ahmedabad  a city in western India  have been indicted on wire fraud  money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation  the department said.

As always  remain vigilant about supposed IRS claims  and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the IRS. The IRS never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards)  or threatens to bring in the police  immigration officers or other law-enforcement. Communication always begins over snail mail. Hopefully these arrests will serve as a warning to others trying to prey on vulnerable populations.

/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,I made a spreadsheet for people who don't know how to budget!,"Hey guys! last year I made a spreadsheet to help myself budget- I'm terrible at sticking to a budget so I made a sheet that breaks it down so that I just have the ability to break it down to a daily manageable amount.

[Heres what it looks like](https://imgur.com/a/ojaju7a)

I grew up very poor and had NO sense of what or even HOW to start budgeting. I was taught that money would disappear if I didn't use it  so I just USED it. Even now I still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if I'm not careful. Another problem I faced is that I have ADHD  so impulse control can be hard  and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. This spreadsheet is made so you only focus on ONE number.

&#x200B;

The sheet was set up with three goals in mind:

&#x200B;

1. that it be easy to use
2. that it focuses on a daily budget that supports long term goals- instead of a long term budget that doesn't have daily support
3. that it be a good starting place for people who have never saved before

&#x200B;

So how does it work?

The main budget is divided into three core areas:

&#x200B;

* Income: You use this to fill in your income and choose to have a monthly  weekly  or bi-weekly pay cycle. If you are a worker who is tipped it includes an area where you can add tips  my suggestion is put in your minimum average income from tips- So for example  if you usually make 100 from tips a week  even if you get extra  try to program your budget around the 100 minimum average.
* Expenses:  There you can add your expenses. Utilities are bills that are for electricity  heat  phone  internet  or water. Bills are important expenses that you can't miss and are integral to living. Finally  expenses are other things you need to allocate money for- whether it be gas  lunch expenses  transportation- ect. Within your expenses there are TWO areas to which you need to pay attention:-Credit Card Payments: this is new to this year's sheet  use the tab below to fill out your information for up to three credit cards. Decide whether to pay the minimum payment OR choose an amount to pay. The tab will allow you to see how much you're paying and how much interest you're accruing.  Once you have filled it out  your budget will adjust accordingly.-Big Purchase: Use this tab to create a budget for a large purchase  and adjust your budget easily and automatically to finance this purchase!
* Budget summary:  Finally the most important part of this sheet is the budget summary- Here you will see just how much you can spend. This money is shown in three ways  the lump monthly sum  a weekly amount  or a daily amount. As long as you don't go over that number  you will have enough money for the rest of your budget. It will also feature a breakdown of what your budget it  where your money is going  and what your income VS spending is!

&#x200B;

[~~Here is a link to the sheet~~](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YCjtrGVKUM7siXilSaqnlHXwemH-QGBEULZBm5bEDMg/copy)

&#x200B;

ou use it like this

* Go in
* Make a copy
* Change the numbers
* Decide what percentage of your income you want to be saved
* Budget.

The sheet includes three charts:

* A bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving
* A pie chart to see where your money is distributed
* A daily Pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings

I don't work well with a lot of budgets because I have issues imagining the big picture. By giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget I can make sure that on any given day I haven't spent more than I'm allowed to- and if I do i can see where I'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

&#x200B;

/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,Stop Spending Money on Food! -- BUY A CROCKPOT,"**Holy shit at the money people spend on food!**

And I was the exact same way when I landed my first job out of college.  You know what I'm talking about--biscuit and Starbucks on the way to work  lunch out with coworkers and pizza and beer at the local tavern for dinner!  Every night!  All week!  Professional money spender!  And more beers and dinners on the weekends!  Woohoo!

Wait.  Where did all my money go?  And how the hell did I gain 40 pounds in six months?  If you're nodding your head you've fallen into the brand-new-job-big-salary-eat-out-because-I-can trap.  And you have to stop it.  It's killing your bank account  it's killing your financial freedom and it's killing *you*. (Literally--I was on the edge of type 2 diabetes and had hyperglycemia during routine physicals.)

**What you know you need to do: *STOP EATING OUT***

But how??? How do I stop eating out???  Fast food is *soooo* good!  And cooking is *soooo* hard!  Well  first off  not really--you're just attuned to that garbage 'food'.  You're going to break free of both these stereotypes and someone has already invented it.....

>Crockpot.  It's the crockpot.  Crockpot.  Crockpot.  Maybe you call it a slow cooker  but I'm from Georgia and here it's a crockpot.  

***!STOP!***--If you do not own a crockpot I highly recommend you go buy one from Amazon and buy the biggest one you can afford!

Get one with a timer that switches to warm after the cook settings: *JUST GOOGLE IT CAUSE MODS DONT LIKE LINKS!*

**BOOM!**  $39 investment.  We're going to make that back in.... *three days*.  Are you ready?  We're going to make enough food for dinner *AND* left overs for lunch.

I'm going to give you some of my super-secret-I-eat-this-every-week-crockpot-meals that are delicious  cheap  filling and easy.  Yes.  The crockpot makes *all* of those possible.

**MEAL 1: Thick Cut Porkchop with Potatoes and Carrots**

>Servings: 4

>Ingredients:

>1 Can Beef Broth (50 cents)

>1 Packet Brown Gravy Mix (50 cents)

>1 Packet Onion Soup Mix (50 cents)

>1 Package of 4 Thick Cut Porkchops ($7)

>6 Carrots (50 cents)

>4 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)

>Sack o' Salad ($2)

>Total cost for lunch and dinner: $13/4 about $3 each.

>Spray or wipe crockpot with cooking oil.  Add beef broth  gravy mix and onion soup mix and stir.  Place porkchops in broth.  Chop carrots and potatoes and add to top of porkchops.  That's it.

>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home make your salad and dig in.  Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**MEAL 2: Sausage  Potato and Kale Soup**
>Servings: 4

>1 Pound Italian Sausage ($4)

>1 White Onion ($1)

>1 32 Oz Box of Chicken Stock ($1.50)

>1 Bag of Prewashed Kale ($3)

>3/4 Cup Heavy Cream ($1)

>5 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)

>1 Head of Garlic ($1)

>Total cost: About $14/4 = 3.50 a serving

>Brown italian sausage with chopped garlic and chopped onion.  While meat is browning add to crockpot the 3/4 cup of heavy cream  chicken stock  and chopped yukon potatoes.  Add browned sausage and top with half the bag of kale.  (I get two recipes per bag of kale).

>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home dig in! Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**MEAL 3: Super Awesome Easy Chili**
>Servings: A Lot (6-8?) -- I eat this *all* the time and it's delicious.  Stores really well in the refrigerator (and chili gets better over time!)

>3 Cans of Black Beans ($2)

>2 Cans of Hot Chili Beans ($1)

>2 Cans of Red Kidney Beans ($1)

>8 Cans of Diced Tomatoes ($6)

>1 Pound of Ground Beef ($4)

>1/2 Cup of Chili Powder ($1)

>1/4 Cup of Garlic Powder ($1)

>1/4 Cup of Onion Powder ($1)

>3 Tablespoons of Cumin ($1)

>3 Tablespoons Black Pepper ($1)

>Edit: The spice proportions are correct!  This makes nearly two gallons of good (about 7L).

>Edit: Salt to Taste($1)

>Total cost = $20/8 = About $2.50 per serving

>Drain the tomatoes and kidney beans but don't drain the black or chili beans.  Brown the ground beef.  Add everything to the crockpot and stir like crazy.... and that's it!

>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home dig in! Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.


It's easy guys.  It's really easy.  You spend 15 minutes a night and you make *tons* of food for lunch and dinner and you save a LOT of money!  AND ITS GOOD FOR YOU! (better than Wendy's--that's for sure!)  AND ITS EASY!

**Stop spending your money on eating out and go full crockpot!  I am much happier and much wealthier!**

EDIT: For our vegetarian friends.  You can't get any more simple than this!

**MEAL 4: Baked Potato**
>Servings: As many potatoes as you bake

>1 Potato

>Cover in tin foil and place directly in crockpot.  Cook on low 4-6 hours or keep on warm all day.


**MEAL 5: Vegetable Soup**
>Servings: However much you want to make

>Tomatoes  Potatoes  Green Beans  Zucchini  Carrots  Peas  or Onions

>Vegetable Stock

>Onion Powder  Garlic Powder  Salt and Black Pepper

>Add vegetables in any proportion you desire to crockpot and add vegetable stock until covered.  Season to taste.  Cook on low until vegetables are tender.

EDIT 2: I live in Georgia and shop at Kroger--prices may vary.  If you live in Canadia or buy organic free range vegetables harvested by hipsters with a minimum of a master's degree you will obviously pay more.

EDIT 3: ""Just learn to cook!""--Yeah  okay guys.  I agree.  I cook more than just in a crockpot.  This post was inspired after I read a /r/personalfinance about a single guy who spends $1300 a month on food because ""he didn't have enough time to cook with work"".  I wrote a very long comment and just made it into a post.  The point was you can eat decent food in a short amount of time and save money by planning one day ahead.  

EDIT 4: I agree fresh vegetables are better and these aren't the *healthiest* recipes.  This post was just to encourage those that eat all the time to transition to something healthier... and then they can transition to something even healthier... and on and on until they've become a raw vegan  growing their own vegetables  saving the whales and composting regularly.

EDIT 5: Electricity costs: Crockpots seem to consume between 200W and 700W per hour.  That's between 2 and 6 kWhs for 8 hours of cooking.  That's about 15 to 60 cents.  It seems insignificant relative to the overall cost of food.

EDIT 6: I'm not a shill or marketing person for crockpot.  I'm a mechanical engineer.  Don't believe me?  My first post on reddit ever was about bolt failures:  https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3e20vs/bolt_failure_modes/ctatj1y/

/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,Quick Reminder to Not Give Away Your Salary Requirement in a Job Interview,"I know I've read this here before but had a real-life experience with it yesterday that I thought I'd share. 

Going into the interview I was hoping/expecting that the range for the salary would be similar to where I am now. When the company recruiter asked me what my target salary was  I responded by asking  ""What is the range for the position?"" to which they responded with their target  which was $30k more than I was expecting/am making now. Essentially  if I would have given the range I was hoping for (even if it was +$10k more than I am making it now) I still would have sold myself short.
