/r/announcements/,announcements,Update to Our Content Policy,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/)  we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods  outside organizations  and our own teams  we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First  a quick recap

Since our last post  here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors  clarify our policies  make mods' lives easier  and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays)  including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**  including both our immediate actions (e.g.  today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls  sustainably enforcing the new policies  and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts  it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level  [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/)  measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit)  aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes  chats  modmail)  and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately  it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term  this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities  including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule  along with specific examples  in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic  personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome  but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy  we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits  the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities  about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so  despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1)  antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8)  and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now  we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings  mod changes  quarantining  and more.

Though smaller  r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear  views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith  without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect  with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users  you will always have more context  community vernacular  and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support  you need more support from us as well  and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors  abusive behaviors  and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity  discussions  and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment  with today’s update and those to come  makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback  we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",spez,06-30-2020,False,1593565818.0,False,False,False,40429,82,79,,20674,0
/r/announcements/,announcements,Upcoming changes to our content policy  our board  and where we’re going from here,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate  a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here  and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people  I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being  who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin  and as someone who literally has a platform and  with it  a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week  I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it  many of the responses said something like  “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions  which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart  are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company  and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years  hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users  as mods  and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However  as Reddit has grown  alongside much good  it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily  despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems  and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects  it’s served us well. Under it  we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said  we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do  articulates none of the values behind the rules  and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to  a statement on hate  the context for the rules  and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through  and while we will move quickly  I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement  the timeline is weeks  not months.

And just this morning  Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing)  my Reddit cofounder  announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate  a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long  I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place  where we have made progress  and where  despite our best intentions  we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit  2005–2006  our idealistic “policy” was that  excluding spam  we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested  we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end  we acted based on our beliefs  despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time  in addition to rapid user growth  Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015  my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown  which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment  because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/)  [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/)  [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/)  [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence)  we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves  we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed  both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018  I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules  but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald  a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies  “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit  and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly  we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism  which makes us proud  and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said  this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years  we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter  and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual  but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

/r/announcements/,announcements,Changes to Reddit’s Political Ads Policy,"As the 2020 election approaches  we are updating our [policy on political advertising](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) to better reflect the role Reddit plays in the political conversation and bring high quality political ads to Redditors.

As a reminder  Reddit’s advertising policy already forbids deceptive  untrue  or misleading advertising (political advertisers included). Further  each political ad is manually reviewed for messaging and creative content  we do not accept political ads from advertisers and candidates based outside the United States  and we only allow political ads at the federal level.

That said  beginning today  we will *also* require political advertisers to work directly with our sales team and leave comments “on” for (at least) the first 24 hours of any given campaign. We will strongly encourage political advertisers to use this opportunity to engage directly with users in the comments.

In tandem  we are launching a subreddit dedicated to political ads transparency  which will list all political ad campaigns running on Reddit dating back to January 1  2019. In this community  you will find information on the individual advertiser  their targeting  impressions  and spend on a per-campaign basis. We plan to consistently update this subreddit as new political ads run on Reddit  so we can provide transparency into our political advertisers and the conversation their ad(s) inspires. If you would like to follow along  please subscribe to [r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/) for more information.

We hope this update will give you a chance to engage directly and transparently with political advertisers around important political issues  and provide a line of sight into the campaigns and political organizations seeking your attention. By requiring political advertisers to work closely with the Reddit Sales team  ensuring comments remain enabled for 24 hours  and establishing a political ads transparency subreddit  we believe we can better serve the Reddit ecosystem by spurring important conversation  enabling our users to provide their own feedback on political ads  and better protecting the community from inappropriate political ads  bad actors  and misinformation.

Please see the full updated political ads policy below:

*All political advertisements must be manually approved by Reddit. In order to be approved  the advertiser must be actively working with a Reddit Sales Representative (for more information on the managed sales process  please see “Advertising at Scale”* [*here*](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising)*.) Political advertisers will also be asked to present additional information to verify their identity and/or authorization to place such advertisements.*

*Political advertisements on Reddit include  but are not limited to  the following:*

* *Ads related to campaigns or elections  or that solicit political donations;*
* *Ads that promote voting or voter registration (discouraging voting or voter registration is not allowed);*
* *Ads promoting political merchandise (for example  products featuring a public office holder or candidate  political slogans  etc);*
* *Issue ads or advocacy ads pertaining to topics of potential legislative or political importance or placed by political organizations*

*Advertisements in this category must include clear ""paid for by"" disclosures within the ad copy and/or creative  and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including those promulgated by the Federal Elections Commission. All political advertisements must also have comments enabled for at least the first 24 hours of the ad run. The advertiser is strongly encouraged to engage with Reddit users directly in these comments. The advertisement and any comments must still adhere to Reddit’s* [*Content Policy*](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)*.*

*Please note additionally that information regarding political ad campaigns and their purchasing individuals or entities may be publicly disclosed by Reddit for transparency purposes.*

*Finally  Reddit only accepts political advertisements within the United States  at the federal level. Political advertisements at the state and local level  or outside of the United States are not allowed.*

The world is experiencing a moment of incredible uncertainty and stress; and throughout this time  it’s become even more clear how valuable Reddit is to millions of people looking for community  a place to seek and share information  provide support to one another  or simply to escape the reality of our collective ‘new normal.’

/r/announcements/,announcements,Introducing Reddit Polls  An All-New Post Type,"If you’re looking for an opinion on anything — the most underrated TV show of the nineties; the very best drugstore mascara; the most athletic NFL player of all-time — there’s no better place to get honest answers and gauge consensus  than on Reddit.

Today  in an effort to elevate Reddit’s diverse opinion-based content  we’re excited to introduce Polls: a brand new post type that encourages redditors to share their opinion via voting. We’ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months  and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited to now release this post type to everyone!

**Why Polls?**

It can sometimes be tough for new redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit    and to feel a sense of community. We believe a simple post type that reduces the posting barrier will make it easier than ever for everyone to contribute to their favorite communities and engage in different ways.

Here’s a look at some of our recent test polls

I’ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**

Hi all 

It’s that time of year again when we share Reddit’s annual transparency report.

We share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit  and how it’s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.

You’ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year  we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically  a breakdown of content policy removals  content manipulation removals  subreddit removals  and subreddit quarantines.

## By the numbers

Since the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long  I’ll call out a few stats below:

**ADMIN REMOVALS**

* In 2019  we removed **\~53M** pieces of content in total  mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating)  exclusive of legal/copyright removals  which we track separately.
* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations  we removed
   * **222k** **pieces of content** 
   * **55.9k accounts**  and
   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).
* Additionally  we quarantined **256 subreddits**.

**LEGAL REMOVALS**

* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content  of which we complied with **37.3%**.
* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018  largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.

**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**

* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.
   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests  mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).
   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.
   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).
* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid  Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)

## While I have your attention...

I’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.

When we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/)  we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms  it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.

Today  we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings  followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.

## If you’ve read this far

In addition to this report  we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit  and if you like posts about what we’re doing  you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity  r/ModNews  r/redditmobile  and r/changelog.

/r/funny/,funny,IMPORTANT PSA: No  you did not win a gift card.,"Hey  folks!

As some of you may already be aware  certain users are receiving private messages – ostensibly from moderators of large subreddits – in which they are told that they've won a gift card  a cash prize  or a robotic ferret. (I may have made that last one up.) Anyway  we wanted to take a moment to inform everyone of the following:

**If you receive a private message telling you that you've won something  it is a scam.**

There are a number of ways that illicit accounts operate on Reddit. More often than not  spammers pump up their karma scores until they're past a certain threshold  then either sell their accounts or start submitting links to malware-infested websites and shady retail outlets. ([This brief guide](https://redd.it/3jss04) will tell you how to spot them... and if that's too long for you  [this tongue-in-cheek video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) will offer the same information.)

More recently  though  we've seen this new breed of parasite making the rounds. They register usernames that look like they could be associated with various Reddit communities (provided that you don't examine their profile pages too closely)  then they contact users directly  thereby bypassing most of what moderators can do to combat them. If you receive one of their messages  here's what to do:

1. Do not click any of the links that it provides.
2. [Report the account to the administrators](https://www.reddit.com/report).
3. Block the account in question.

Remember  everyone  if something seems too good to be true  it usually is.

That's why we don't have robotic ferrets yet  sadly.",RamsesThePigeon,03-19-2020,False,False,False,False,False,402,13,8,,4438,0

/r/Showerthoughts/,Showerthoughts,IMPORTANT PSA: No  you did not win a gift card.,"Hey  folks!

As some of you may already be aware  certain users are receiving private messages – ostensibly from moderators of large subreddits – in which they are told that they've won a gift card  a cash prize  or a robotic ferret. (I may have made that last one up.) Anyway  we wanted to take a moment to inform everyone of the following:

**If you receive a private message telling you that you've won something  it is a scam.**

There are a number of ways that illicit accounts operate on Reddit. More often than not  spammers pump up their karma scores until they're past a certain threshold  then either sell their accounts or start submitting links to malware-infested websites and shady retail outlets. ([This brief guide](https://redd.it/3jss04) will tell you how to spot them... and if that's too long for you  [this tongue-in-cheek video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) will offer the same information.)

More recently  though  we've seen this new breed of parasite making the rounds. They register usernames that look like they could be associated with various Reddit communities (provided that you don't examine their profile pages too closely)  then they contact users directly  thereby bypassing most of what moderators can do to combat them. If you receive one of their messages  here's what to do:

1. Do not click any of the links that it provides.
2. [Report the account to the administrators](https://www.reddit.com/report).
3. Block the account in question.

Remember  everyone  if something seems too good to be true  it usually is.

/r/IAmA/,IAmA,IAmA Supports Black Lives Matter,"The IAmA Team stands strongly against the brutality inflicted on the Black people of America. As protests grow across the country  and police respond with escalating violence  we want to give a voice to those who don't have a platform. Over the coming days and weeks  we want to amplify Black voices who need and deserve to be heard. If you are one of these many  many  many voices  we invite you to do an Ask Me Anything on our subreddit to share it  answer questions from the community  and provide insight to those wanting to listen and learn.

We want to make something very clear: this is not temporary support. We will continue to support the Black Lives Matter movement with AMAs from prominent Black leaders until Reddit folds and we cannot host AMAs on the site anymore. The brutality and systemic racism that Black people face in the United States are the result of a fundamentally broken system — one that supports white people at the expense of those who are not; one that permits those in power to murder Black people and go unpunished; one that does not value the lives of Black people the same way it does the lives of white people.The opposite of racism is not complacency or saying that ""I don't see color;"" it is anti-racism.

The IAmA Team stands in solidarity with the Black community — against police violence  against systemic oppression  and against racism. To that end  we want to share a number of resources  to help those who read our AMAs learn how to be better allies and to be anti-racist. You can find those resources here:

/r/IAmA/,IAmA,I'm Sarah  a Professor at The University of Manchester. I'm using my astrophysics research background to identify ways to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions... from food. Ask me Anything!,"EDIT 2PM: This AMA is now closed - thank you so much for all your fantastic questions! 



Hi Reddit  Sarah here! I have been studying dark matter and dark energy for the last 20 years  but when my kids started school I started to think about our own planet in the next 20 years and beyond. I learned about climate change properly for the first time  how it threatens worldwide food production  and how food causes about a quarter of all global warming. I wanted to know how much each of my food choices was contributing  and why. Did you know  if we stopped burning fossil fuels  food would be the biggest contributor to climate change?

I delved into the academic research literature  and summarized the results in simple charts. The charts make it easy for the non-specialist to see the impacts of different meal options  and show that some easy food switches can reduce food greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent. Most of us make many food choices every day  and by changing these we can significantly reduce climate change caused by food  and free up land that can be used to help reduce climate change overall.

There is an impending perfect storm of pressure on our food production system  with increasing population and changing consumer tastes  in the face of rising temperatures and extreme weather events. Tim Gore  head of food policy and climate change for Oxfam  said “The main way that most people will experience climate change is through the impact on food: the food they eat  the price they pay for it  and the availability and choice that they have.”. Yet  at the same time  food production causes about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions  and this is rising as the population increases and becomes more affluent. 

My book  Food and Climate Change -- Without the Hot Air  is published today by UIT Cambridge in 2020 www.sarahbridle.net/faccwtha #faccwtha You can get the e-book for free  thanks to funding from the University of Manchester e.g. in the UK the free ebook is available from amazon here https://www.amazon.co.uk/Food-Climate-Change-without-hot-ebook/dp/B0873WWT6W

/r/IAmA/,IAmA,I am Kai Strittmatter. I have written a book on China  the mechanisms of dictatorship and digital totalitarianism. Actually it is also a book about us. AMA,"Hej from Copenhagen. My name is Kai. I grew up in a little village in the Bavarian alps  went on to study Chinese and ended up devoting more than half of my life to the study and observation of China  many years as a reporter in Beijing for the German national daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Over the course of more than 30 years I have made invaluable friendships in China  eaten the best food in the world and seen the country change  for the better and for the worse. 
 
The past seven years under the leadership of China’s strong man Xi Jinping have been especially remarkable. Repression and censorship are as strong as they haven’t been for decades  ideology has crept back. At the same time Xi Jinping is reinventing dictatorship with the means of AI and Big Data  he is giving autocratic rule a digital update. All the while China is growing more assertive on the international stage. Competition of systems is back - and it comes at a time when liberal democracy finds itself in the midst of a deep crisis. 

For me this challenge we have to rise up to was the main reason to write my book  We Have Been Harmonized.
 
So go ahead and ask me anything: about the new China  about the new us  about reporting from China  about the best noodles on the planet  why everybody should learn Chinese or why I started working on my book the night when Donald Trump was elected president of the United States.

/r/IAmA/,IAmA,Why do we lock people up? We’ve spent eight months reporting on stereotypes and misconceptions about the criminal justice system – and now we have a podcast! AUA!,"Hi there. A majority of Americans say they think incarceration should be about rehabilitating offenders. But a majority of Americans also say the justice system is not harsh enough. How do we reconcile these two  often competing  goals? 

We’re reporters who’ve spent eight months producing a podcast that challenges what we think we know about the U.S. criminal justice system. Over six episodes  we take on questions like the one above  as well as: Is it true that most people in American jails have not been convicted of the crime for which they were arrested? Would closing down private prisons really end mass incarceration? And does more immigration really mean more crime? 

We spoke with formerly incarcerated people  reform advocates  a former ICE attorney turned immigration lawyer  crime victims/survivors  researchers. Our goal is to sort out where public opinion and reality don’t align – or  in some cases  where our perceptions contradict each other – when it comes to the criminal justice system. 

The podcast is called [Perception Gaps: Locked Up](https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps/Season-2-Locked-Up) – Season 2 of the [series](https://www.csmonitor.com/Podcasts/Perception-Gaps) – and we’re all reporters with [The Christian Science Monitor](https://www.csmonitor.com/)  an international (and secular – we know  the name) Pulitzer Prize-winning news organization.

_____________________________________________
I’m Emily Skopov and I’m running to represent the 28th legislative district of Pennsylvania because  like many of you  I expect more from  our government  and I know our families deserve it.  


People have  lost faith that the values on which America was founded are being upheld  by our elected leaders. Too many of the policies coming out of  Harrisburg and Washington  D.C. don’t adequately solve the problems  facing hard-working Pennsylvanians. Many feel defeated and hopeless  about a system that seems corrupt and rigged. I’ve raised my children not to wait for someone else to solve a problem but to instead step forward to be part of a solution. And with all the problems demanding  attention in our communities  I knew it was time for me to step up and  run.

I learned the value of hard work from my parents  a small  business owner and a public school teacher. I attended public school in my working class community and learned the importance of high-quality  public education to provide children with the tools and opportunities to build themselves a meaningful  rewarding and productive life. I worked at my dad’s neighborhood  drugstore and learned the critical skills of financial planning and budgeting;  valuing and investing in your employees  customers  and community;  contributing to and encouraging growth in the local economy; and how to  quickly adapt to changes in the market. My passion for  and commitment to  small businesses is rooted in their flexibility  responsibility  and  loyalty — they have to be there for their customers and accommodate  their needs through even the most difficult times.

This solid  working-class foundation allowed me to obtain degrees from Columbia  University and the University of California Los Angeles  and to have a  successful career as a screenwriter and director before moving to Marshall Township in Allegheny County with my husband and family a  decade ago. Since then  I have committed myself to my community by  volunteering in the North Allegheny Schools; starting a nonprofit that  prevents environmental waste and gets educational and art supplies into  the hands of those who need them most; being appointed to Marshall  Township’s Parks and Recreation Board; serving on the boards of the Northland Public Library Foundation  Braveheart Foundation  North  Allegheny Rowing Association  and as a founding member of our  synagogue’s social justice task force; and now  running for office to serve and advocate for this community both locally and in Harrisburg.

I am running because my  community wasn’t being heard and their values weren’t being represented  in our state government. I believe that elected officials are public  servants and that it is a privilege to be the voice of our community. The political extremism that has paralyzed our government and turned neighbors against one another must end  and I  will restore common sense in the public interest to government.

This  is my second run for this seat. In 2018  I came within 9 points of then  Speaker of the House Mike Turzai  and he opted to retire rather than to  take this campaign on a second time and risk defeat. This district is the fastest Democratic-trending state house district in Pennsylvania. We have built a campaign that is now polling ahead of our opponent  and with  hard work and abundant support  we're going to flip this seat  and with it  the Pennsylvania legislature.

/r/gifs/,gifs,/r/Gifs rules: Please read before submitting or commenting,"# [New to reddit? Click here!](/wiki/reddit_101)

#**.gif  .gifv  .ogg  .mp4  and .webm format submissions only  please!**

#**Submissions cannot contain sound**

**If there is a violation of the rules  *please* click the report button and leave a report  and also [message the moderator team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgifs) and report the problem if it requires more detail.**

------------------

1. **Reposts and Crossposts:**
 * Do not post gifs that have already appeared on /r/gifs . Moderators may allow gifs that have gotten an extremely low score in the past  but *that is not guaranteed.* 
 * Do not post gifs that have gotten more than 1500 points (at the time of posting) elsewhere on reddit *in the last two weeks*. This includes videos converted to gif formats. Cross-posts after this time are allowed. 

  **[Please use Karma Decay to see if your gif has already been submitted.](http://karmadecay.com/)**  
 **Frequent violations of this rule may result in a ban.**

  Please help us enforce this rule by reporting offending submissions. Please include a link to the original reddit submission in your report or modmail if you have it.
   
 *This rule is meant to keep things fresh. Reposts will be removed  however a good gif that did very badly the first time around may be given a second chance. We also don't wish to discourage cross-posting in general (it's even encouraged by reddiquette)  but if something was recently popular elsewhere  we want to let the original post stand on its own for a while before it comes to /r/gifs.*

 *Please note that the cross-post rule applies* ***at the time of posting***. *We don't want to punish users who were within the rules when they made their post. For example  if a post has 1000 points elsewhere  and someone cross-posts it here  but a few hours later the original post has gone past 1500 points  that's fine.*

2. **No Reaction  HIFW  Analogy  Cake Day  or Upvote gifs.** There are already subreddits more suited for this kind of content. (This rule does not apply to comments)  
   
 *The [/r/reactiongifs wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_a_reaction_gif.3F) explains this well. Just because a gif has a reaction in it doesn't make it a reaction gif.*

3. **Do not post gifs that should be videos.** Incredibly long gifs *or content much better suited to video formats* will be removed.  **20 seconds maximum duration.** (This rule does not apply to comments)  
   
 *Gifs are a short-form format  so if a gif doesn't provide any benefit  or a video format is preferable  it isn't allowed. For example  these may be removed...*
 * *Gifs that require audio to be properly appreciated.*
 * *Gifs with many cuts to different scenes.*
 * *Gifs with a file size over 15mb.*

4. **Direct image links REQUIRED**. No links to image pages or albums are allowed  your submission must be a single gif image. **Direct links that end in .gif  .gifv  .ogg  .mp4  and .webm format only.** URL-shorteners are **NOT** allowed in posts or comments!  
  
 *Image/gallery pages are prone to malicious ads or editing in spam in the text areas  so we require direct linking to prevent this. URL shorteners are on reddit's site-wide spam filter  because you can hide anything in a URL shortener and people have no idea what their browser will open.*

5. **No depictions of real-life harassment or assault in posts or comments.** There are other subreddits dedicated to this kind of content.  

6. **No witch-hunts or brigading in posts or comments.** Do not encourage any online or real-life harassment  and don't encourage people to downvote other posts/comments.  
  
 *This includes trying to rile people up over another reddit user's activities. There are always many sides to everything  and we've seen reddit go after the wrong person many times.*

7. ***Nudity  porn  gore  and other obscene material are not allowed in posts or comments - No exceptions.*** Failure to comply will result in removal of post and banning. There are other subreddits dedicated to NSFW content. **Please mark risqué posts and comments as NSFW.**  
  
 *Risqué posts (girls in bikinis  for instance) are fine as long as it's tagged as NSFW and isn't overtly sexual. Porn  gore  nudity  and sex acts are bannable offenses in posts or comments. Anything causing grievous bodily harm or death is considered gore  even if there's no gore shown.*

8. **Titles must be descriptive.** Do not make submissions with the title ""This""  ""This is my favorite gif""  etc.

9. **No hate speech of any kind in posts or comments.** Racist  sexist  homophobic  or otherwise abusive submissions or comments will result in an immediate ban.  
  
 *Making fun of or belittling any person or people based on race  sex  gender  sexual preference  disability  or other characteristics is likely to get you banned. Language that goes past the standard ""internet tough guy"" banter may result in a removal or ban  depending on the severity.*

10. **Please familiarize yourself with the [official rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/) and [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).** We will remove any posts or comments violating reddit's official rules (spam  personal information  vote manipulation  etc.) and reddiquette just makes reddit a better place to visit.

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etk5jj/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxii/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other  voice concerns to the moderators  and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences  AND 

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics  Engineering  Social Sciences  etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology  Quantum Chemistry  etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties  myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients  etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades  or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally  these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

       Username: /u/foretopsail
       General field: Anthropology
       Specific field: Maritime Archaeology
       Particular areas of research include historical archaeology  archaeometry  and ship construction. 
       Education: MA in archaeology  researcher for several years.
       Comments: 1  2  3  4.

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However  several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity  and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

+ Inflation: The mind-bogglingly fast expansion of the Universe in a fraction of the first second. It turned tiny quantum fluctuation into the seeds for the galaxies and clusters we see today
+ The Cosmic Microwave background: The radiation reaching us from a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. It shows us how our universe was like  13.4 billion years ago
+ Large Scale Structure: Matter in the Universe forms a ""cosmic web"" with clusters  filaments and voids. The positions of galaxies in the sky shows imprints of the physics in the early universe
+ Dark Matter: Most matter in the universe seems to be ""Dark Matter""  i.e. not noticeable through any means except for its effect on light and other matter via gravity
+ Gravitational Lensing: Matter in the universe bends the path of light. This allows us to ""see"" the (invisible) dark matter in the Universe and how it is distributed

As far as I know neurotransmitters are only released  bound to receptors and reuptaken in the synpatic cleft. I that is the case  then what's the point of multiple neurotransmitter types if chemical signal is going to only be translated into a binary electric signal that is 1 (excitation of the membrane)  while none is 0 (resting membrane potential)? For me  in my limited knowledge  it appears as if their existance is useless since electrical signals alone or just a single neutrotransmitter type would suffice  unless neurotransmitters were released into the intracellural space and all neurons in an area of the brain with specific receptors would pick them up  which isn't a case in models I can find on the internet or in books.

/r/books/,books,The /r/books book club selection for September is D-Day Girls by Sarah Rose,"From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41449260-d-day-girls):

>The dramatic  untold true story of the extraordinary women recruited by Britain's elite spy agency to sabotage the Nazis and pave the way for Allied victory in World War II.  
>  
>In 1942  the Allies were losing  Germany seemed unstoppable  and every able man in England was fighting. Churchill believed Britain was locked in an existential battle and created a secret agency  the Special Operations Executive (SOE)  whose spies were trained in everything from demolition to sharp-shooting. Their job  he declared  was ""to set Europe ablaze!"" But with most men on the frontlines  the SOE did something unprecedented: it recruited women. Thirty-nine women answered the call  leaving their lives and families to become saboteurs in France. Half were caught  and a third did not make it home alive.  
>  
>In *D-Day Girls*  Sarah Rose draws on recently declassified files  diaries  and oral histories to tell the story of three of these women. There's Odette Sansom  a young mother who feels suffocated by domestic life and sees the war as her ticket out; Lise de Baissac  an unflappable aristocrat with the mind of a natural leader; and Andrée Borrel  the streetwise organizer of the Paris Resistance. Together  they derailed trains  blew up weapons caches  destroyed power and phone lines  and gathered crucial intelligence—laying the groundwork for the D-Day invasion that proved to be the turning point in the war.  

This month we will be reading D-Day Girls: The Spies Who Armed the Resistance  Sabotaged the Nazis  and Helped Win World War II by Sarah Rose. Sarah will be joining us for an AMA on **Wednesday September 30th.**

/r/books/,books,I just completed Mockingjay and I am too stunned to say anything.,"I started the Hunger Games series back in August and completed the whole three books in just a matter of two weeks. I just completed the final one and holy shit. 
..

This book has been brilliantly plotted and paced. All the twists and the compelling action are not only entertaining but they serve a higher purpose of what the whole series is about. Rarely do I see this perfect blend of artistic perfection along with gripping entertainment. 
I totally didn't see the end coming. Katniss losing her sister just because Coin decided to drop a bomb on a group of children to make the Capitol look like they killed their own children. I knew there was something fishy with President Coin herself when it was revealed that she might have Katniss killed if she got the power of Capitol. Katniss's conversation with Snow in the end and that council meeting where Coin proposes a Hunger Games involving the Capitol kids cement the fact that Coin is no different from Snow. In overthrowing a dictator  Katniss didn't realise she was working alongside another one. Also  Katniss's grief after losing her sister is truly well written. It really made me cry. Especially the part when she and her sister's cat  who she hated  reunite. Both of are in mourning. Both of them find solace in each other's loneliness. Peeta still remains in touch with Katniss but it takes time for their relationship to come back to normal. I felt truly bad even for Haymitch. Given all that he has suffered  his death might have been a sweet release for him. 
..

I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

I’m currently reading the 2nd part of Faust  and with limited knowledge of greek mythology & European history  it hasn’t been such an easy reading even with the annotations. However  I still find myself enjoying it  which is something that rarely happened while reading books.

My method is usually to read the thing  then read analyses which help me understand (academic ones  not Reddit).

 But so far this book has felt like a sea of confusion with no end in sight. It is particularly disheartening when the editors notes act like it's obvious when it's not.

/r/LifeProTips/,LifeProTips,Rules simplification,"Hello LPT subscribers  

This community has existed for nine years and has more subscribers than some smaller countries have citizens. (Belgium has 11.4m) 

We find  that over time our rules have become bloated and unwieldy  making the subreddit hard to moderate and more importantly  difficult to post to. 

Each rule we have was added for a very good reason at the time. (In the sidebar there is a rule saying no tips about rubber snakes. A few years ago there was an issue with rubber snake tips.)

But over the years we have added rule after rule and never removed any and this resulted in rules creep   a sort of nightmarish morass you guys need to navigate when you want to post here. 

This ends today. We're massively overhauling the rules  removing most of the restricted tip list and making participating here a  lot easier.

------------------------------------

**Rules that we will keep**

No tips about:

Legal  parenting  driving  tips that break the law  hygiene (including toilet)  religious  relationship  troll/ joke.

And no ads. No tips that are really just recommending a product or service. No ""Get Disney+  it's great"". 

----------------------------------------

It's going to take some time to get all this arranged  especially automod is a complete disaster of rule upon rule and legacy code that requires detailed attention. During this transition some posts that are not technically against the rules anymore may still be removed. We also reserve the right to keep removing content under moderator discretion  when we feel it's not a good fit for the sub but is not codified in our existing ruleset. 

But in general we feel that this overhaul will make it much simpler and enjoyable to participate here.

Literally two days later  I was having a 4-hour drive to pick up my father from the closest airport. On my way there  a storm hit and I was soaked. What would’ve been a miserable remaining 2 hours in my car  I got saved by that extra set of clothes I had prepared a few days before. The underwear  socks  and shoes helped the most!!

I took a couple handfuls of cereal and munched on one piece at a time so that I could have something to do during the entirety of the lecture. Having my hands busy really curbed my urge to reach for my phone or engage in something else. 

For me  it was sort of like watching a movie at the theatre while eating a bag of popcorn. And in a way  it transformed my lecture into some sort of entertainment that I could manage to sit through  simply because my hands were busy.

Maybe this is valid  maybe not; either way we thought we'd do something about it and get some men in here.  

Naked men. Ostentatiously naked men.  *Gloriously* naked men.  

**The Full Monty**

Here are the rules:

1. We will accept submissions for the next month.   The final date will be **September 26  2020**.  There is no limit on the number of unique submissions.

2. To participate artwork must be titled **""The Full Monty""** (although please stick to the other title requirements  e.g. *'The Full Monty  me  charcoal on paper  2020'*).  As an example: [our first entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/ig4hr9/the_full_monty_by_nadia_vanilla_digital_2020/).

3. All artwork **must** be original content.  You may use your name in the title  as long as it is your own work.

4. At the end of the contest period we mods will pick a winner based on net upvotes  and a weighted mod vote.  

5. Submissions must have at least **one male figure**.  As mentioned  full frontal nudity is encouraged   so please flag the post NSFW where appropriate.

6. Bonus points if the art stylizes  idealizes  and even *objectifies* the male figure in some form  satirizing the way the female figure is often represented here.  Details of this are  as always  up to individual creativity. 

7. The winner will be stickied for another month  and get bragging rights.  We will also hand out additional awards like gold and badges for exceptional merit.

/r/blog/,blog,New “Start Chatting” feature on Reddit,"Hi everyone 

We wanted to give you a heads up about a new feature that we are launching this week called “Start Chatting.” This past month  as people around the world have been at home under various shelter-in-place restrictions  redditors have been using chat at phenomenal new levels. Whether it’s about topics related to COVID-19  local news  or just their favorite games and hobbies  people all around the world are looking for others to talk to. Since Reddit is in a unique position to help in this situation  we’ve created a new tool that makes it easier to find other people who want to talk about the same things you do.

Redditors can visit a community and click on the ‘Start Chatting’ prompt  which will then match them with other members of that community in a small group chat. In our testing  we’ve already seen some interesting use cases for Start Chatting  such as meeting new people within conversation-oriented communities  discussing cliffhangers from the latest episode in our TV show communities  or finding others to game with online. We’re excited to see other use cases emerge as more and more redditors get access to this feature.

&#x200B;

Start Chatting begins rolling out today and will become available to even more communities in the coming weeks.

For more information  please refer to the [Start Chatting Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/chat/start-chatting) that answers common questions about the feature and has details on how to report abuse.

Let us know if you have any questions or feedback!

/r/blog/,blog,Reddit in 2019,"It’s December  which means it's that time of the year to cue up the ""Imagine "" overpromise and underdeliver on some fresh resolutions  and look back (a little early  I know) at a few of the moments that defined Reddit in 2019.

You can check out all the highlights—including a breakdown of the top posts and communities by category—in our official [2019 Year in Review blog post](https://redditblog.com/2019/12/04/reddits-2019-year-in-review/) (or read on for a quick summary below).

/r/blog/,blog,Just Launched: Easily Share Reddit Posts Directly to your Snapchat Story!,"We’re excited to announce our new integration with Snapchat  which enables Reddit iOS users to seamlessly share their favorite Reddit content with friends in the Snapchat app.

**How To Share**

Redditors who have the Snapchat app installed will be able to share their favorite Reddit posts with friends in a Snap! To share Reddit content in Snapchat  redditors simply tap the “share” icon on any post on Reddit's iOS app and select the Snapchat option. Then add it to your Story so all your friends can see it or choose a few friends to send the post to.

**The Experience For Viewers**

Snapchatters will see unique Reddit content in their Snaps and Snap Stories via a new sticker designed specifically for the integration  which includes Reddit logo and source information. If the Reddit mobile app is installed  the viewer can simply swipe up on the Snap to visit the original post in the Reddit mobile app. If the viewer does not have the Reddit app installed  they will be taken to the App Store to download Reddit on iOS upon swiping up on the Snap.

(Plus  announcing the winners of our in•cred•i•ble contest!),"Back in May  [we announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/) an updated new feature  Custom Feeds (née ""multireddits""). This feature is a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and help newer redditors discover more communities. We also announced a community contest to see which redditors could create the best Custom Feed for a variety of categories. Today  we’re here to announce the winners and ~~give them a few scraps of Silver~~ shower them in Premium.

# First  a few highlights

Since we announced the update  we’ve already seen:

* Over **300 000 custom feeds** have been created
* Over **10 000** of you have **followed another redditor’s feed**
* The **most followed feed** has a variety of “Hold My \_\_\_” subbies and was created by u/waldrich. Naturally  it’s called [**/holdmyshit**](https://www.reddit.com/user/wardrich/m/holdmyshit/)
* The **second most followed** feed is your one-stop spot for all of the NBA teams’ subreddits. It’s succinctly named [**All NBA**](https://www.reddit.com/user/8unk/m/feed_me/) and is by u/8unk.

# Now on Android

Custom Feeds are ready to go for Android! It’s part of version 3.31  which shipped on July 15th. Android redditors: you can now create and edit your Custom Feeds  plus follow your favorite feeds. (Before this update  you could only consume existing Custom Feeds.)

As a way of fostering a sense of community and engagement here on /r/sports we have decided to set up a discord server for our subscribers to chat about any sport with many other users from around the world!

You'll be able to select which sports channels you are interested in and which ones to opt out of as well as participate in general discussion of many sorts with other users.

We have channels set up for game threads  so if you ever need a place to discuss any event from around the world with others right there with you then we hope that will end up the place to go!

As the server grows we plan to set up other channels and add other goodies for the users to get use out of.

Keep in mind that this is brand new server so activity levels will be low to start  but the goal here is to have a moderately active server soon  and what better time to start than when we have nothing else to do since many of our favorite sports are on hiatus!

So come hang out and talk about just about anything (SFW only) with other sports fans  both hardcore and casual.

We appreciate any members that decide to join and hope you have fun!

/r/television/,television,Rewatching The Wire. Season 4 has to be for me  one of  if not the  best single season of a television show.,"Seasons 1-3  as great as they are  and with the multitude of characters  had The Wire becoming the McNulty show. Taking the decision to push McNulty back enabled the show to concentrate fully on the stories of the four kids and how the actions of everyone around them and in Baltimore such as the councilmen  police (rank and file)  the school system  parents  and peers  shaped and moulded the children to become an individual snapshot of a cross section of Baltimore life. By the end of the season you were left feeling helpless and pity for where they all ended up.

I can’t say I’ve ever watched a show that has left me angry one moment  and happy the next from what is being shown on screen. Knowing that the stories  whilst fictional  are based on reality from David Simons time as a reporter and documenting Baltimore life only adds depth to the watching experience.

While this is a small milestone and there’s plenty of growth left to take place  I think there are a few key things that I’ve learned along the way… and these are things that can be applied to starting any venture from the ground up.

1. Set a goal that you can control
2. Aim for Consistency
3. Be open to making sacrifices
4. Identify what you enjoy about the process
5. Pay attention to the market (or audience)
6. Have Patience

There are certainly many other values and practices that matter  but these were the most pivotal to my growth online. I expect these keys to be applicable for any other entrepreneurial venture as well  and leaning into these practices will allow you to start from a stronger place. I discuss this in depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVZzBUaOUDU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVZzBUaOUDU). Let me know if there are any other pillars that you rely on when pursuing your own ventures.",Chellz93,09-06-2020,False,False,False,False,False,0,0,0,,10,0

A few years ago I met a bisexual dude who was around 25 years older than me. I was 23 at the time. We met through an app similar to Grindr. We meet up  hook up  end of it. Never met again. Around 2 weeks or so later I start dating this 20 year old girl. Things are going ok and about 3 weeks in the relationship we are walking through a park when she stops me and tells me that her dad is there and I should meet him. It's a bit soon  sure  but it's not like formal or anything so I agree. Lo and behold though  her daddy is the dude that was calling me daddy a few weeks back. We both freeze and stare at each other in absolute horror not knowing what to say. We awkwardly shake hands  girl attributes it to nervousness. 2 weeks go by and one day she calls me to meet up. When I get there she is absolutely fuming. Like  I can literally see smoke coming out. She goes off on me about how could I possibly do this to her. I obviously have zero clue what she is on about. She tells me that her dad came clean to her and her mom about being bisexual and told his daughter  my gf  to break up with me so he can be with me. And apparently it was my fault because I was the one that turned him gay. So she throws a plastic container at me and storms off. Never heard from any of them again.

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by thinking my fiancé only had two years left to live,"So this happened a couple hours ago. To explain  my fiancé(M28) has a birth defect that affects his kidneys  and we always knew one day that he would need a transplant. We didn’t expect it as soon as we got it though  which was earlier in this week. He starts dialysis Monday. 
Anyways  in the heat of explaining to me the medical call he had earlier that morning  he said something along the lines of  “I have two years to get the transplant.” 

The pessimist in me took that sentence and ran to the darkest depths  thinking “he has two years left of LIFE.” I’ve been a mess for the last two days  and that’s putting it sweetly. 
So today  I was pressing him about all the places we needed to apply  ways we could get the word out  etc  and I mentioned that we only had a two year deadline. His face fell into confusion  and he was like  “What?” And I explained to him what I THOUGHT he had explained to me  that he only had bittersweet time left. Let me tell you that this poor man instantly came to me in pure concern  telling me I totally misunderstood and that he  in fact  would not die in two years. 

I have never felt so happy to be so dumb in my entire life.

Yesterday  I asked her if she's able to drive me to an appointment and she agreed. During my appointment  her GYN doctor called her and she's able to rush quickly to see her. My sister was 5-months pregnant  so she rushed and left me at my doctor appointment and agreed to pick-me up afterwards.

An hour later  she came picked me up and said   ""I have bad news"".. I thought she got a parking ticket or something so I responded ""Who Died?"" She responded ""The baby"". (She was five-months pregnant  so it was a fetus.)  I was a bit confused because I wasn't expecting that response.

She chuckled  but responded  ""Not the response you were expecting  huh?"" ""She was very forgiving about my sarcasm. We drove to home and bought  take-out and desserts to help cope with the sad news.

UPDATE: She had to drive back home to discuss options with her husband. Yes  the unborn baby is still inside her. She is having an induced labor tomorrow.

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by asking a coworker going through an emotional and unpleasant divorce if she wanted to date,"I am the manager at a local coffee shop. A new employee that normally worked at a different location was covering a shift for someone at my store. I reached out to her usual manager to ask if there was anything I needed to know about her before we were to work together. The only thing her manager told me was that she was a good employee and that she was going through an awful divorce and sometimes needed emotional breaks. 

Fast forward and we are working together. I am making drinks and she is taking orders. Everything is going fine. She takes an order and puts the cup down and tells me it's a latte  ""straight up"" (to imply no flavoring). I repeated it back  ""Straight up?"" She replies  ""Straight up"". I reply  ""Now tell me is it gonna be you and me together?"" (Finishing the lyric to the song ""Straight Up"" by Paula Abdul). It became clear by the immediate change in the look on her face that she was not familiar with the song and took it as me hitting on her. I was mortified and had to explain that I was referencing a song. We finished our shift together and everything was fine  but that one moment crushed me.

 I was in my classroom when suddenly my classmate who was sitting behind me asked me: 

>are you gay?

 I didn't know what it was to be gay so I asked him what it was  He told me it meant to be smart.    
I believed him  so he asked again: are you gay? 

 I had good grades back then (I thought being smart was the same as getting good grades lol)    
then I answered:

>Yeah i think so...

he looked at me with a smirk and ended the conversation.

 I spent the rest of the day thinking about what he said to me  since I did not know that word before  I thought it was some sophisticated term or something like that. 

 So i planned to tell my best friend i was ''gay'' as i thought i would look very sophisticated saying that.

  It's time to leave school  I see my best friend in the distance and then I shout: 

# ''I AM GAYYYYYY''

 He looks at me and replies: 

# -''WHAT????''

# -''YEAH DUDE I FOUND OUT THAT I'M GAY''

 At that moment  all the students who were also leaving look at me  some perplexed and others laughing.

 Due to this reaction  I wonder if what my classmate told me was true. I come home and ask my mother  and then I realize...

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by wrecking my ass  a toilet  and my dignity  all in the span of one night,"So this is my obligatory “this actually happened 15 years ago ” but I still feel the pain of it as if it happened today. Also  I know that “sex sells” on this sub  so I guess in a way this story is about me stretching my anus and screwing myself. 

As a teenager at a Summer Camp one year  the Camp must have gotten donated like a metric ton of Cheddar Cheese  because they would have it cut up with every meal  cubes of cheese just constantly. Every snack  crackers and cheese cubes  every meal  spaghetti with a side of cheese cubes  sloppy joes with cheese cubes  soup and sandwich with a side of? You guessed it  cheese cubes. It was like dying and going to whatever Wisconsin considers heaven to be like. 

You have to understand that as an active 15-year-old male experiencing an unrestricted cheese-pass for the first time  I LOVE cheese. With a passion that bordered on obsession. 

Some of you can already see where this is going  but as a naive teen  I didn’t know then what I know now  as it pertains to cheese and one’s ability to have a normal poop. So after days and days of eating almost nothing but cheese cubes  I developed an opiate-addict level of constipation. Like  severe abdominal distress  barely able to function  experience labour contractions  sit on the toilet for an hour and cry  constipation. 

Eventually one morning  I summon the courage to ask the Camp Caretaker: “can you please buy me some laxative from town? I am horribly constipated”. Thank God  later that morning  with exlax in hand  I boldly face the rest of the day  blissfully unaware of the carnage set before me. 

That was  until evening time came. By the time evening chapel was a go at 7pm  the miracle of modern medicine had turned my body into a violent  bathroom-clearing  toilet-clogging giant turd machine. 

Birth pangs start to hit me just as chapel time is about to start. As quietly as I can manage  I waddle to the bathroom  stopping along the way for the contractions to pass. I don’t need a doctor to tell me I am fully dilated. This cheese baby is about to be delivered  and there is no doula in the world that is going to walk me through this. By the grace of God  I am utterly alone. 

I wish I could describe to you what happened over the course of the next  20-145 minutes (time had no meaning to me anymore)  but I think it’s one of those repressed memories that my body won’t let me recall. I remember the pain  and the groaning. And I remember crying tears of joy and relief that it was finally over. Looking back  I wish I had known what Lamaze breathing was  because I’m certain it would have helped.

The thing about giving birth is that at least you get to hold a baby at the end of it. It’s the miracle of life. Instead  I still had to find a way to make this painful memory flush. Imagine the irony of having to track down the same Camp Caretaker to now ask him for a plunger. “I guess those laxatives worked ” he said with a wink. You have no idea buddy. I now know what it’s like to be in prison  except I was the one hurting my own anus. 

In the end  it was a stick from the woods that saved my pride and smooshed that coke-can-sized log down that poor underpowered toilet. 

I only wish Reddit had existed back then  for perhaps I would have heard tale of a poop knife  which might have shielded my honour. 

And that’s the true story of how I destroyed my ass  a toilet  and my dignity  all in the span of one night.

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by buying condoms in front of my dad’s friend.,"
So I (17) have been dating my boyfriend for 6 months. We were supposed to go on a date later tonight so I went to target earlier in the day to buy condoms. I got into a checkout line and since it was long I basically had my face buried into my phone. When it was my turn finally  I looked up to see one of my dad’s friends. I was super uncomfortable but I figured that maybe it wouldn’t be a big deal  after all it’s just condoms. He didn’t greet me or anything  it was just an awkward silence. After I left target I went home to try on different dresses for my date with my boyfriend. As I was about to start getting ready  my dad comes home from work yelling at me saying I can’t go anywhere now. I kept repeating what what what did i do and he sternly said “Show me what you bought at target” and I just stood there realizing I’ve met my doom.

I never got to go on my date. I won’t be going on any dates for a while actually. I’m grounded for a month now. So that’s fun.

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by unleashing my baseball swing on a piñata and ruining it for a bunch of kids,"This wasn’t recently  but still worth telling.

I’m from a Hispanic community and it’s common to have a piñata for younger kids birthday parties. 

I’m at a family friends birthday party  their son is 6 and I’m hanging out with the siblings that are my age at the time of the story (16). Piñata time roles around and they must have made this thing out of industrial grade steel reinforced concrete  because an army of 6 year olds each given like 30 seconds to whack this thing don’t even make a dent.

So after like 15 kids  the piñata is still standing and the kids want the damn candy. Ok  call in the big boys. 

“u/ArgentinaMalvina! Come hit the piñata for the kids!” 

Ok  nows my time to be the hero. Not to brag but I’m not exactly weak  and I’m a very good baseball player  I hit piss missiles and dick slaps over the fence. So no trouble I’ll let these kids feast on the fruits of my labor. 

I step up to the batters box  wind up  and WHACK. The full force of my baseball form swing is unleashed onto the piñata which simultaneously explodes and flies off its rope. It goes sailing across the yard  like 10 feet away right into the street and scatters its goods across a huge area mostly in the road. Cars are going by  and these are 6 year olds. 

They rush over to grab the stuff but the parents intervene and prevent them from grabbing the stuff and running in the street. Most of the candy was unobtainable  cue disappointment.

/r/tifu/,tifu,TIFU by yelling at the CEO of my company to “SHUT THE F*CK UP”,"
Had a company-wide zoom call this morning with my CEO (medium sized company) giving a quarterly report. 

Cue me  the dumbass  that uses Bluetooth headphones during these meetings  who thought it would be a good idea to yell at my neighbors barking dog.

Now  I usually have to yell at my neighbors dog every morning and he goes back inside (neighbor and I are good friends  and his fluffy buddy is just a barker)

Anyway  I triple check that I’m muted while the ceo is rambling off about some sort of multimillion dollar building expansion In front of 300 people on the call. I go outside and I yell “HEY! SHUT THE FUCK UP!”

Well I quickly found out that I wasn’t muted  after my manager kicked me off the call. Now awaiting a private call and apparently I earned the eyes of the CEO on my name (hes an extremely religious guy  by the way). Safe to say I’m fucked

TLDR: thought I was muted on zoom  yelled shut the fuck up at my neighbors barking dog  religious CEO that was giving a presentation to 300 people now wants a private conversation with me.",520athletic,09-06-2020,False,False,False,False,False,58,0,0,,356,0

/r/history/,history,Daoist practices between 800-1200  with a focus on the provinces of qinghai  gansu and xinjiang,"Hello fine people 

I´ve asked the same question in r/askhistorians  for i suppose that answering it requires some in depth knowledge  but i´m also interested in what the hive  or people who don´t have the time to write an answer conforming to the standard of r/askhistorians  might come up with.

i adore philosophical daoism and i´m also a huge fan of the recently released game ""Crusader Kings 3"". This game offers the opportunity to play as various medieval rulers and dynasties and it´s a lot of fun.

It also allows one to play in parts of the provinces mentioned in the title  as a daoist ruler  which  considering my interest in daoism  is great fun.

Yet  it´s obviously only a game and it lacks nuance and depth. While it offers some information on religion  most can only be considered an very rough approximation  if at all.

But i would like to know how exactly  if it at all existed in the area  daoist religion would have looked liked in the years 800-1200  outside of china proper  in the provinces of qinghai  gansu and xinjiang along the silk road.

The game labels the daoism followed by some characters as ""Zhengyi-Daoism""- But information on it is quite scarce.

Or rather; All the information i find refers to practices and times far earlier or later or is very general  making it hard to decide when and where a certain practice or tradition was in place.

I´m especially interested in the following aspects:

1. How widespread was daoist practices during this time frame in the aforementioned provinces? Did it exist at all  if only amongst some rulers  or does the game take some liberties here?
2. What did religious practice look like?
3. How was the clergy organized?
4. The wikipedia mentions talismans and spells. How widespread were those and how did they look like? Which alchemistic practices were in use?
5. It also mentions the concept of bestowing ""registers""  espousing the schools teachings  on people entering daoism. Was this done in the mentioned timeframe? Was this only for priests?

I took a cursory glance at two sources mentioned in the wikipedia  the ""Taoism: Growth of a Religion"" by Isabella robinett and the ""The Encyclopedia of Taoism"".

But i didn´t find too much so far. Especially the second book seems to contain a lot of information  but again  it seems hard to get information on the place and the timeframe i wish to explore. I only took a cursory glance  though  and would appreciate any input as to where to find the information i want in those books.",CrusadingCapybara,09-06-2020,False,1599338693.0,False,False,False,14,0,0,,209,0

/r/history/,history,Educational Timeline of the British Throne and others.,"I have been working on a series of timelines that tell the story of the British Throne and have had some praise for the work on Reddit. I hope to create educational resources that tell history in a way I never had at school; and to that end they must be as accurate as possible within the parameters of a poster/page/slide.

I make these on PowerPoint because I am too cool for any other possible tools. I am also a simple man. 

The first one I put on /r/dataisbeatiful in two versions  [WIP](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ieg4c9/oc_monarchs_of_englanduk_revision_guide_wip/) and [Final with PDF link](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ii1m3h/oc_monarchs_of_englanduk_revision_guide_v2_pdfppt/). I have highlighted important events to situate the historical time. Any constructive comments would be welcome again. 

The next one is am working on it a less Anglo-centric chart of the British throne  [currently WIP.](https://i.imgur.com/FsMKLe0.png) The events highlighted are those that I think are crucial to the formation of the modern United Kingdom (Reformation  Treaties  Rebellions and Colonies etc.)  but of course  I can't include everything. 

1. I would love to see what a more history minded community thinks  and also have I made any mistakes?
2. Any comments on my current WIP would be most welcome. More Welsh/Irish inclusion  changes visually/aesthetically etc?
3. What other timelines could be simplified to the degree I have tried  but also educational and interesting to see in a similar fashion. I will look at the French throne afterwards  but the European thrones do get very intertwined easily. Chinese dynasties  Prime Ministers and Important Laws  any ideas?

/r/history/,history,The Largest Naval battle In history,"I was wondering what peoples standings are on the largest naval battle in history   you commonly see people saying it battle of Leyte gulf   however if you look at actual scale and numbers ancient battles such as the battle of actium (estimates of 400+ ships) Or even the ancient  battle of Battle of Cape Ecnomus (that had an amazing 680 ships in total) 


These numbers dwarf the around 300 ships and 400 Planes that took part in the battle of Leyte gulf  


I understand that these ancient numbers are oftenly shrugged off as many argue  the numbers are inflated and incorrect  and many also argue that the battle of Leyte gulf is the most decisive naval battle in history  which is also debatable since the battle of Battle of Cape Ecnomus saw Rome’s First Major Naval victory   and also practically won he first Punic war   and the battle of actium  decided Who / if there would ever be an emperor of Rome 

But also many rightfully claim a Japanese victory at Leyte gulf could of completely halted the American advance at could of Changed the result of WW2   though it is still arguable that the Allies still would of crushed the Japanese regardless   but would of been delayed 


I also understand that the massive technological difference considering the Massive Battleships and Cruisers aswell as even the destroyers were huge compared to the relatively small ships Of Ancient times

/r/history/,history,How did late christian roman scholars cope with their ancestors  being at least partly responsible for the death of Jesus Christ?,"It's always confounded me how the Roman Empire turned from a polytheistic religion into a monotheistic one under Constantine the Great. No matter how you cut it according to the Bible even though it was jewish judges who sentenced Jesus to death  it was roman soldiers who carried out the crucifixion and Judea was at the time a Roman province.

I've never read what later roman scholars thought about their own countrymen being at the very least partly responsible for the death of their savior. Did they put all of the blame on the jews who sentenced Jesus? Did they denounce Pontius Pilate for not intervening  or maybe they saw Jesus death as something necessary for the salvation of humanity? Was the emperor at the time (Tiberius) seen as a devil by christian thinkers for not recognizing Jesus whilst he walked on eart?

/r/history/,history,Was there any other terrorist group in history like Shindo Renmei  Japanese immigrant who denied Japan's defeat in WWII?,"I find the story of Shindo Renmei fascinating  knowing it through a film Corações Sujos (Dirty Hearts).

As in many of the Allied countries during the war  Brazil discriminated against  and even imprisoned  immigrants from countries coming from the Axis. Thus  many Japanese and Brazilian-Japanese needed help even to feed themselves  and several groups  usually of a nationalist nature  was created for this purpose. Shindo Renmei was at first one of these groups that helped Japanese immigrants in Brazil during World War II.

However  after Japan's defeat  Shindo Renmei did not believe what happened  but that Japan won the war and the enemies wanted to deceive them. They even believed that Japan would soon send a boat to take them back to the country. They even distorted and falsified information that came from Japan. However  what stood out the most in this group was that for them  worse than a Brazilian saying that Japan lost the war  was that of a Japanese to believe it. Because of this  Shindo Renmei persecuted and murdered several Japanese and Japanese descendants in the interior of Brazil. After several murders  members of the group appeared with the weapon they used in the police station and confessed to the crime  something that is common in honor crimes.

I would like to know if in the history there were any groups similar to Shindo Remnei.",DELAIZ,09-05-2020,False,False,False,False,False,1,0,0,,7,0
/r/philosophy/,philosophy,Open Letter to Steve Huffman and the Board of Directors of Reddit  Inc– If you believe in standing up to hate and supporting black lives  you need to act,"**Please don't give this gold**. The account is our trusty bot  so it won't be useful to anyone. We'd rather have you donate to your local Black Lives Matter organization. [Here is a list of suggestions](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/where-to-donate-for-black-lives-matter.html).

*The following is an open letter we  the moderators of /r/philosophy  signed. You can find the original post on /r/AgainstHateSubreddits. You can find our previous  short statement against racism [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gwdl8c/against_racism_and_police_violence/).*

Dear Steve  
On June 1  you shared a letter on Reddit’s blog  [“Remember the Human – Black Lives Matter”]( https://redditblog.com/2020/06/01/remember-the-human-black-lives-matter/).  In this letter  you claim “as Snoos  we do not tolerate hate  racism  and violence  and while we have work to do to fight these on our platform  our values are clear.” 

As of today  neither you nor any other Reddit admins have shared this letter anywhere on reddit.com. However  [the response to this message was swift on Twitter]( (https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106)  where you were rightfully labeled as hypocritical based on your long and well-recorded history of defending racism and white supremacy on this site.  

Among the many responses was this message from former CEO of Reddit  Ellen Pao. 

>[I am obligated to call you out: You should have shut down the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hate  racism  and violence. So much of what is happening now lies at your feet. You don't get to say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long](https://twitter.com/ekp/status/1267689503797342208)

Many others shared links and screenshots of your past statements saying [“Open racism and slurs are fine to post on Reddit”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/12/racism-slurs-reddit-post-ceo-steve-huffman).

The problem of Reddit’s leadership supporting and providing a platform for racist users and hateful communities has long been an issue.  Nearly six years ago  [dozens of subreddits signed the original open letter to the Reddit admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2ejg1b/we_have_a_racist_user_problem_and_reddit_wont/) calling for action.  While [the Reddit admins acknowledged the letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2m9k6p/maybe_its_time_to_repost_the_open_letter_reddit/cm27j8j/) and said it was a high priority to address this issue  extremely little has been done in the intervening years.

On June 5  you shared this update on /r/Announcements  [Upcoming changes to our content policy  our board  and where we’re going from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/).  In the post  you stated that there is a need for continued adjustments of Reddit’s content policy to address racism and that this remains a priority.  These continued statements that you hear us  that this is a priority  or that you are working on it are not enough.  It has been five years since your return as CEO and this still remains Reddit’s most glaring problem.

Steve  if you and Reddit genuinely care about the values of standing up to racism and hate  then you need to back it up with real action.  As moderators on this website who have dedicated countless hours to keeping this site running  we call on Reddit to take the following steps:

* **Enact a sitewide policy against racism  slurs  and hatespeech targeted at protected groups.** For too many years  Steve Huffman and the other Admins have stood by and allowed this site to fester with hate in the name of “free speech.”  It is time to enact a specific and detailed policy that protects the disadvantaged members of our communities from hate based on their sexuality  gender identity  ethnicity  country of origin  religion  or disability.

* **Be proactive in banning hate-based communities**  In the past Reddit has only taken action on hate subreddits when they were featured in the news and risked Reddit’s reputation or when they were documented and featured on /r/AgainstHateSubreddits and other forums.  AHS should not have to be responsible for raising awareness of hate subreddits and reporting them to the admins.  This site should take responsibility for keeping its users safe by banning any remaining subreddits devoted to hate and racism and preventing the creation of hateful subreddits in the future. 

* **Be proactive in banning hate users** Reddit needs to not only ban hate subreddits  but must be proactive in banning the moderators of these subreddits and their most active users.  Too often these users have been allowed to stay on this website after numerous sitewide violations  letting them move on to participate in new hate communities and spread their vitriol further across this site.

* **Reddit needs to hire more minorities / women  especially in leadership roles** Reddit needs to hire more women and people of color — particularly in leadership roles in the company — to help shift the corporate culture and policies to be more equitable for all.  In addition  Reddit needs to take adequate steps to protect these employees from harassment. 

* **Reddit needs to hire more community managers** According to Reddit's [job listings](https://www.redditinc.com/careers) there are dozens of open positions that the company is hiring for  and yet not a single one for Community.  Reddit has enacted numerous policies over the years that have been detrimental to the ability of Reddit’s moderators or the broader Reddit community.  Reddit needs more community managers to build positive relations and engagement with the site’s volunteer moderators.

* **Honor Alexis Ohanian's wishes to have his Reddit Board seat filled with a black candidate** - On June 5  Reddit Co-Founder and Executive Chairman [announced that he would be stepping down](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1268943036228292608) from his role on Reddit's Board of Directors.  Alexis requested that his position be filled with a black candidate and we ask Reddit to honor that request.  While you have stated your intent to honor that request  we are asking for an announcement to be made on this decision in the next 3 months.  We believe this is not an issue that should be put off for action years down the road.

At /r/AgainstHateSubreddits  we have laid out the many failures of Steve time and again to stand up to white supremacy on this site [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gv7mtn/steve_spez_huffman_is_finally_claiming_that_black/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/a3q6ck/2018_reddit_review_a_year_of_hate_propaganda_and/) and [time]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/84q74p/bbc_calls_out_rthe_donald_for_being_a_thriving/) again.
With a website with the impact of Reddit on the broader conversations being held in communities around the world  this website needs real leadership and real action.

We hope that Reddit will not just share empty platitudes — but will take a meaningful stand against hate  and take these recommendations to heart.
This letter is co-signed by more than 200 communities representing well over 200 million subscribers:

*As a reminder to all of you writing for Theme Thursday: the interpretation is completely up to you! I love to share my thoughts on what the theme makes me think of but you are by no means bound to these ideas! I love when writers step outside their comfort zones or think outside the box  so take all my thoughts with a grain of salt if you had something entirely different in mind.*

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,7 days ago I turned 29  I pray I never turn 30.,"Before I tell you my part in all of this  I need to go back to where it all began;

My ancestor Eizo Nakamura was  by all accounts  an asshole. But an opportunistic one. 

*“Seize the day  the night and all the bodies that bask under it with their jewellery unprotected!”* He declared in his journal that fateful night one late summer’s evening in 1866  bragging about how he’d scored another heist with his brother; Minato Nakamura  that they’d survive the famine and “buy all the hookers they could ever want” with the leftover sums. Most folks aren’t buried in Japan  in fact 99.8% of them are cremated  so Eizo wasn’t robbing graves. 

He was robbing corpses before they were cremated. 

Eizo was resourceful  careful and precise. He would pick the bodies of those who he knew had very few relatives  Minato would pay off the mortician  and they’d ransack the corpse before anyone came to pay their respects. He’d make the excuse that it was to stave off starvation during the Tenpō famine of 1833  starting when he was just a boy in Honshu and lasting until he was in his teens. But he continued to steal long after that. Which brings us to why we’re here today.

His greed would ultimately bring ruin upon every male member of the Nakamura bloodline. 

On the last winter solstice he spent in Japan  now in his late 30s and with a young family  Eizo and Minato resolved to rob the home of a Shinto Priest in the region  knowing his young son was riddled with consumption and soon to pass. With distraction plaguing the Father’s mind  Eizo knew it would be a simple task to rob him blind. 

*“The job is easy  we wait in the trees on the night they come to give the young master his rites and upon their departure  sneak in and claim what we know he won’t miss.”* he was giddy with excitement  lord knows his arrogance given he documented these “raids”. 

Sure enough  as documented  the pair lay in wait and watched as the priest’s contemporaries filed in one by one and read the poor boy his last rites. The grief-stricken Father seeing them out with despair written across his face  clearly too distraught to do them himself. As he thanked them outside  Eizo & Minato snuck around the back and entered the home. 

When they found the sickly boy  laying in his bed and barely breathing  it seems that Minato felt a pang of guilt and wanted to hold off.

“These are the hours of the Ox  it’s unwise to do this now. Besides…” He cast his eyes to the boy  Eizo noting the regret in his eyes. “He’s still alive. He could make a scene…” before casting his gaze forward to the Priest’s safe room  the door slightly ajar and promises of priceless artefacts  donations and food laying just out of reach. 

*“I wasn’t about to let some child not long for this world get in the way of our job. Besides  the sick should give way for the strong and where his boy was dying  mine was most certainly living. So  I did what I had to…”* 

What that turned out  it seemed  was suffocating the life out of the child. Eizo reported he thrash ever so slightly before falling limp  an errant hand the only thing still clasped tightly to Eizo’s forearm in the moments following  as if clutching to the last vestige of life he’d ever come to know.

To his credit  Minato punched his brother in disgust  questioning if he was even sane to do such a horrific thing  let alone in the hallowed hours between 1 and 3 when the worst could befall them. 

But  the commotion had roused the priest and within moments; he was stood in the doorway  eyes aghast and trembling hands reached out towards the brothers. 

It was at that moment that Eizo  Minato and the rest of our lives would be inexorably changed forever.

I couldn’t tell you exactly what the priest said to them  how his grief rattled voice shook the very foundations of his home as if a typhoon were striking the bows with unshackled prejudice  or if Eizo and Minato ever saw justice for their crime. But I can tell you that whatever specifics were discussed drove Eizo to gather his family and leave for the mountains in 1870  eschewing contact with the outside world and becoming fiercely protective of his boy. At night  he would sit by his front door and with sword in hand  wait with trembling lips and shaking hands. He wrote in his journal; 

*“They always come in the hours of The Ox. They crawl up the foundations of the home and whisper in my ear. Sometimes asking me to do terrible things  other times promising me it’ll all end if I open the door… I saw one of them once; a horned  pale-skinned ogre with fangs the size of my forearm  yellow eyes with the blackest pupils that widened to an ungodly pit when they fixated on me. The voice constantly stuck between hysterical laughter and the most pained sobs. No different to an animal trying to produce human mimicry. It cooed for me to step outside and face what I’d done. But I am a coward and I will not abandon my family.”* 

Eizo wasn’t the only one suffering from these night visits  Minato began thrashing in his sleep every night as his wife struggled to console him. He would flail madly as if fighting off unseen hands  deep lacerations forming on his skin and thick  large bite marks puncturing his soft flesh. Whenever he awoke  sweating and as if he’d aged some years each night  he would refuse to comment on what happened  save for one phrase; 

“We should have never gone during the hours of the Ox. We deserve what we get.” 

It was on his deathbed a mere 4 years later  only 42 but stricken with white frail hair and atrophied muscles  that he looked at a spot in the corner and his eyes grew wide  biting his lip to the point of drawing blood.

“She’s ready for her last meal  it seems. I’m sorry I couldn’t stop it.” With that  he exhaled deeply  his back arching to the point of snapping before he froze  dead.

Eizo lasted a decent while longer  refusing to come to Minatos funeral and effectively shutting out the outside world save for his family on their small rice farm. He watched his three children grow older and  on his eldest son’s 29th birthday  told him the truth behind his episodes. The reason I am here with you all today.

That night  in that home during the hours of the Ox  the Shinto Priest performed what is known as *Ushi no toki Mairi*  a curse placed upon the brothers for their heinous crimes  destined to suffer in both this and the next life. 

Eizo wept and the guilt of his actions overcame him as he apologised profusely to his son Tenzan  the young man not understanding why. 

In those later hours when the knocking on the door grew frantic and the scratching accompanied a deafening wailing that Tenzan whipped around to hear. His Father gasping from his bed. 

“So he was right  you hear it too… Tenzan  look under the tatami plates near our porch. And please… forgive me.” 

He died soon after  leaving Tenzan with the uncomfortable knowledge that every man in my family now carries on their shoulders;  

We are all cursed. Every single one of us. 

Every man in my family begins to see these creatures on their 29th birthday and misfortune befalls them throughout the rest of their days. Sometimes they go weeks without an incident  sometimes hours. It seems to vary from member to member  but as the generations grew  all the men reported seeing them around the time they reached 29. When trying to find the priest who originally placed the curse in order to apologise  they were unable to locate him or anyone who knew him. The search was ultimately fruitless  and each member of the Nakamura clan dealt with the curse in their own way.  

Tenzan tried to maintain the property in his Father’s absence  his younger brother committing suicide the night of his 30th birthday  manic and wild-eyed as he stuck the blade through his belly  right in front of his children. 

“Now they won’t use me as a hive.” He gurgled  blood seeping through his teeth and staining them a dark coffee red as he fell forward. His son would later report hearing an incessant buzzing in his ear  itchiness on his skin and bumps appearing over his body that he couldn’t get rid of. He’d eventually throw himself into the river at the age of 34 as a “cleansing ritual” that he unsurprisingly didn’t survive. 

My Grandfather Hiroshi took his wife and my Dad across the ocean and here to the UK during the second world war  declaring a desire to escape the atrocities of the empire  ply his trade out west and help the British government as a translator. Though my Grandmother would recount that he secretly hoped the sightings would stop if they were blessed by another priest and started over in a new land where these Yokai could not follow. 

He was wrong. 

Within a decade  Hiroshi would be driven to the point of insomnia  refusing to sleep for fear “the spindly thing in the gutters” would rise out of the drain to claim him. He began scarcely washing  only opting to do so when he could take the bucket into the living room so as not to see into the drain. His son  my Dad Jushin  was obviously concerned seeing his Father slowly devolving into nothing more than a husk that babbled on about the rattling of the pipes  the incessant singing that only he could hear emanating from the neighbours above despite living on the top floor and other maladies that ultimately drove Hiroshi to a heart attack when I was just a boy. 

I remember the drive home from the funeral. A shinto burial in London is a rare sight  and though my Dad and I were more British than we were Japanese  we still upheld tradition. My frail nana looking at me from her wheelchair and shaking her head as she pointed to me and spoke to my Mother.

I remember my Father’s white knuckles as he gripped the steering wheel for dear life and screamed in broken Japanese for something to get out of the way  despite the roads being clear.

I remember the car toppling over the embankment and the feeling of inertia washing over me as my small body was thrown around like a rag-doll; my dads promises to fix the passenger seatbelt now coming back to haunt him.

I remember the quiet aftermath. Soft  pained breaths in the husk of that car as I looked ahead and saw my Father’s mangled body crawling back to the dashboard  only half of him making the return trip. 

“Theodore; Ignore the whispers.” He repeated  inter splicing a small chant until his breathing grew shallow and the blue lights blinded him from my vision.

He was 31. To the best of my knowledge  he never once displayed the kind of anxiety or distress previous members had shown. I’d even seen my Uncle and Grandfather in more weathered states around that time  but my Dad  to me at least  seemed immune to it all. Proud of his work and a diligent parent  he always strived to be the best he could. 

But maybe it was that desire to ignore the fate bestowed upon him that caused his end.

So here we are  some two decades later and now my turn. My brother Harry went missing a few years back  though my Mother is convinced it was his wanderlust and that he’s “probably somewhere in South America stoned out of his mind”. But he never took narcotics for fun. Always to quell his paranoia of something following him. 

Harry routinely believed that the stars followed him wherever he went. Particularly one that situated in the East. A “sickly magenta and humming…always humming” as he described it  following him wherever he went  rising and growing as he tried to outrun it. 

I asked him why it terrified him so much when it was so far away  but when his eyes met mine  I understood that there was something else in the sky  something he wouldn’t dare to describe  that was after him. 

“If you saw the glow  heard the hum… felt the presence… you’d know  Theo.” He’d take a deep drag of his cigarette and wave me off  not wanting to discuss it anymore. On the weekend of his 29th  he bade us farewell and set off backpacking  telling Mum he “needed to find himself” while telling me he “hoped the stars wouldn’t follow him there” odd as that statement sounded. 

In my case  I guess I’d prepared for it my whole life. Indulging in horror has been my forte to such a degree that hell  I made it a full-time job  weaving experiences from my life or the lives of those I knew and making them into something to terrify others  knowing full well that nothing would ever match what was waiting for me. 

It started last year on my 28th; I woke up the following morning with a start  the whispering in my ear faint but unmistakably alien.

***“You shouldn’t take your medication today.”*** 

I looked around  puzzled and trying to figure out if it was my sleep addled state  a leftover portion of the dream I was having. Spying nobody and not hearing any follow-up responses  I roused myself out of bed and got on with my day  cursing myself for forgetting my medication and the feeling of something watching me permeating throughout my day.

So  from there  it grew like a cancer. Over the weeks I would feel something placing icy hands around my neck or my stomach  jolting me and causing me to drop something valuable  stumble over in the street and once even careen my car into the back of my Mums. 

With every momentary fright and creeping sense of dread  I could feel this thing grow in confidence and power. 

I spent the remaining part of 2019 researching our family lineage as best I could  trying desperately to find a way to alleviate the curse  to atone for my ancestors’ sins or stave it off. But after numerous overseas calls to our native relatives in Japan and lengthy chats with my Nana  it was to no avail. 

“You can run from it  plead with it  bargain with it  but the curse shall not relent.” My Nana rasped  the sadness gripping her old but kind face. “I lost my husband and my son to that wretched curse  I couldn’t bear to lose you too…” I remember taking her hand and smiling  looking up at her to thank her for her kindness  but not seeing the face of my Nana where her head rested.

Instead  the most grotesque shape stretched itself over my Nana’s skull. Hollowed out eye sockets with amorphous shapes undulating in the black pits  layers of rotting flesh stretching over gangrenous muscle tissue and blackened bone  melding with the mould and the fungal rot amassing around the head. It cocked its head at me as it grinned.

***“You will never see her face again. This is the crushing nature of the Kuri.”*** 

I backed away  softly apologising to my Nana in a cold sweat  my chest tightening and vision growing blurry. I was having a panic attack. 

Managing to get to my car  I tried desperately to calm myself down  punching the steering wheel in frustration as my mind shot back to those final moments my dad suffered through… did he see then what I see now?

So it went  The Kuri kept its promise. First just with my Nana until she died in the spring  then moving onto my cousins  aunts  uncles and in July… my Mother. I’ve tried as many excuses as I can muster in order to put off seeing her  but I think with my age rapidly approaching 30  she senses something is off. 

I finally told my partner about in the week leading up to my birthday. She tried her best to understand  but when she put her hand on mine and suggested I speak to a therapist  I knew it would always be a barrier she’s unable to cross. I couldn’t blame her. To the outside world  it must seem as if our family simply has a history of severe mental illness on the male side. Maybe we do. Maybe it’s just latent in our minds until we finish maturity in our mid-20s and the 29th birthday is simply self-fulfilling prophecy? We expect it to happen  and so it does. 

Last week  a few days shy of my birthday  The Kuri came to me in a dream. Draped in a cloak of muscles and guts  it peered from the tip of the cloak to laugh at me. 

***“You want to be set free  yes?”*** It cooed  my desperation practically palpable at this point. A solid year without proper sleep  communication with my family or a reason to live. I nodded  tears forming in my eyes at the prospect of freedom.

***“Then go to where your Father lost his life. I will return whence I came and find a new victim. I will lead you there.”*** 

I didn’t tell my partner; I didn’t tell anyone. I left a simple note and an excuse why I had to go  deactivated my social media and set off for where he had his accident; Winchester. To those of you not local  it’s a countryside situated 100 miles from London  sprawling hills and surrounded by nature. It was our nation’s capital for centuries. It also has many quiet countryside roads with vast open fields  the kind my Father lost his life on.

As I drove down the dimly lit roads  my sole companion was The Kuri  whispering in my ear.

***“Just a little bit further… you’ll be there soon… I’ll find someone new and I swear I’ll let you go… you never even bore a son… it’s no fun when you don’t react anymore…”***

Exhaustion  misery and hunger gripped my soul as I sped up  desperate to get this thing gone. My mind wracked with thoughts of how my predecessors had succumbed to other members of this creature’s family. How many more would fall? I had cousins. There was still a chance it’d continue…

I saw the long  winding road known as Hatches Lane  the lights barely flickering as my car pulled up near the embankment. Was it here? Maybe it was further… My eyes were feeling heavy  and I struggled to focus.

***“Get out and walk  I’ll take you there… I want to be rid of you…”*** It whispered  the voice almost sorrowful now as I willed my aching frame to move and trudge through the darkness.

How long had it been since I’d eaten? Drank? My mouth felt so dry that swallowing brought the sensation of razors slinking down my throat  eyes felt itchy and my head was pounding. I could barely see  the cold whipping through my bones.

***“A little further… keep going… we’re almost there…”*** My knees gave out  and I felt the darkness take me. The only thing left was the sight of that fucking creature as it grinned. Images of my Father  Grandfather and the other countless men in my family stood silently behind it  heads bowed and shackled with their own abominations by their side tormenting them.

***“I cannot wait to drag you down to hell with me… to join the rest of the Nakamura Clan…”*** It bared its teeth  a yellow tongue oozing pus and lapping around its face in a snake-like manner as it cackled. 

Before I could respond  a blinding light shone through the darkness and I was brought to my senses with worried faces looming over me.

My partner and a pair of paramedics. 

\-

I should be thankful I had the find my iPhone function on my phone and that the note was ominous enough for my partner to look further into. Any later and I doubt they’d have found me. Both she and the doctor chalked it up to a psychotic break pertaining to the families superstition of the men turning 29. I didn’t argue. Nor did I protest going to therapy and spending time focusing on getting better. 

To their credit  I didn’t see or hear The Kuri. 

After some time  I began to think that perhaps things could return to normal  that I’d be able to find some sense of normality amid a sea of misfortune and tragedy. 

But  last Monday  the day after I turned 29  right as the clock turned to 1am through to 3am and entered the hours of the Ox  I saw two things standing at the foot of my bed  my partner sleeping soundly through them all. 

The first was my Father  propping himself up on his elbows  the bottom half of him stood at the side patiently. A look of sorrow across his still youthful face as he turned to glance at the other figure; The Kuri  teeth bared  pale skin cloaked in muscles and eyes that sickly tinted yellow Eizo had seen so long ago. 

“You can run from it  plead with it  bargain with it  but the curse shall not relent.” He breathed as The Kuri cackled  making me fully aware of what the rest of my life would look like. 

My new horrible reality.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,We Found The Youtube Channel of A Classmate Who Died In A Car Accident - PART II,"[PT I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/imxhtr/we_found_the_youtube_channel_of_a_classmate_who/)  


“Some people fear that they’ll die in a plane crash their entire lives. And guess what? They die in a plane crash!  She made a video of a deer. And was killed by one.” I said. 

“Those people don’t make videos with the plane that they know is going to kill them.” Drew said. “And they don’t talk about the plane being part of some cult.”  
“We grew up outside of Pasadena. Where a religious studies teacher’s fascination with Aleister Crowley in our hometown isn’t any different than a musician in Nashville having a fascination with Elvis….” I said. 

“Graceland is in Memphis.”  Drew replied. “Nashville is different.” 

“In the long run Aleister Crowley was successful at bringing yoga to Southern California. The rest of the occult stuff is campfire stories for virgins that weren’t invited to many campfires.” I said. 

“Huck. You love problem solving. You prefer it to sleep. That’s why you take the modafinil. And yet none of this interests you?” he said. 

“Drew. What do you want from this?” I asked. 

A freezeframe of Carey K was on the monitor. At that time she was half the age we are now. More frightened than we have ever been in 15 years. He shrugged.

“So what’s our best outcome? There’s no real mystery here. The deer is dead. She is dead. I’m just failing to see how we get closure  justice  or money in any of this...” I said. 

Drew clicked on a video.  Scrolled past a few minutes.  
*It was Carey K. Opening a book. In a white room. Relaxed on the floor with a candle in front of her.  After a brief moment the camera shifted enough for us to realize that Carey hadn’t left the camera on a makeshift tripod. SOMEONE ELSE was controlling it.* 

*“You really got this for me?” she asked. Full flush on her face.* 

*“No. I wrote this for you. It was meant to find you.” the voice said. “Focus.”*

*“I mean. Look at these drawings. It’s just so….wow. It’s really gorgeous.” she said.* 

*Slowly Carey K’s hair began to rise a bit. As if it had had a powerful static shock from one of those plasma glass balls at the Science Museum touch it.* 

*“Focus now. It’s a book on Fertility. Alchemy. The Unknown Seasons” the voice said. “It carried over from the 14th century. I translated what I could.”* 

*“Oh.” she said.  Her shoulder length hair began to lift up even more. She tried to brush it back down but it stayed up.* 

*“Most people who die. Focus. They go nowhere. Some go to heaven. But not as many as you think. And even then. I suspect they don’t stay there for long. Focus. But if we make it to La Chambre Des Cauchemars. In a few decades  we can be the first to reproduce in the afterlife  Carey. That is the gift that we stole.” the voice said.* 

*“Why…. don’t you think people in heaven stay for too long?” she asked.* 

*“Do you think a person who never talks back to anyone enjoys being alone?” the voice asked.* 

*“I don’t know. I guess so?” she replied.* 

*“You’re losing focus. FOCUS.”* 

*Just then the camera tilted a bit.  For a split second. And it wasn’t totally clear. But it appeared that Carey K wasn’t on the floor at all. She was sitting upside down. On her own ceiling.* 

“You recognize that voice?” I asked. 

“I couldn’t even figure out the accent.” Drew replied. 

We listened to the voice. It was almost transforming every few words. It could have been a 70 year old woman. Or a 14 year old boy. 

“Want to take a stroll?”  I said. 

\----

We went to a 24 Hour Ralphs. Got some chips and watery shit guacamole. Drew stocked up on his own drug of choice : Sugar Free Red Bull. 

Carey K’s death impacted most of us for about a week.  
The first few days consisted of crying  shock  hugging. 

Watching the Evening News Van take b-roll of us in the parking lot.  
Couples that recently broke up getting back together.

A few people spoke out on the overpopulation of deer in our area.   
Some animal lovers lied and said that Carey K would never want her death to result in the death of more animals. 

A faceless quasi-friend of hers spoke at the wake  blaming herself for not carpooling with Carey on the ride home. 

Neither side really got a win. 

And we moved on.  
Events don’t really change much. 

“It was what…. fourteen years after her death when someone uploaded this?” I asked. 

“Yeah. Random dates in 2014  2015  and this last one was in 2017.” Drew replied. 

“How many views?” I asked. 

“15  24  2  3  6  12  2  2.” he said. “And maybe some of those are repeats from me. I don’t know if their system picks up on that.”  
“No comments?” I asked. 

“No comments.” Drew said. 

“It’s like they had a connection to her. Enough to transfer minidv to Youtube. But they didn’t have a strong enough will to share it with anyone else connected to her.” I said. 

“Can you maybe check public records to see about her will?” Drew asked. “Maybe her mom’s too?” 

I bent over the computer. Clicked on the comments section. 

*Hey There. Old friend of Carey Ks. How did you find this video? Also  who is the creeper talking to her about Fertility? Thanx.*

“Sometimes just asking is the easiest way of finding out.” I said. And pressed send. 

I drove home near the crack of dawn. Never a stranger to late night workaholicisms  I weighed the options of helping.

And whether helping Drew meant that I gave a damn about Carey K or the Youtube Channel.

Because I didn’t want to.

A few days passed. My trial ended. My weekend started. 

12 people completed their civic duty by letting another rich douchebag free due to charm and grudges against a system that forces them into jury duty.  
I even got confirmation that a reliable enough consultant to the firm was pulling up files we found on Carey K  her mom  her absent dad  and some random police reports.  

As I left my office for celebratory drinks I saw a Mercedes Sprinter in the parking lot. 

It was Drew. Holding up a folder and waving ‘hi’. 

I waved back. 

“Drew. How’d you find my office?” I asked. 

“My brother knows your firm.” he said. “He also got me ALL of the files. AND….Say hi to Stig.” 

Black bushy eyebrows. Pale skin. Dark eyes. Stig Hjortshøj waved at me from the passenger seat.  
He was wearing scrubs. On his day off. To remind me that he was Dr. Hjortshøj now

At our high school lunch table he was once labeled an Aristocratic Cybergoth.  
Now he gives colonoscopies to Clint Eastwood. And Facebook Updates us every time he watches an rerun of Big Bang Theory with his winter wear fashion czar wife  Meaghan. 

“Man. You know it sucks like Carey K’s death that we haven’t seen each other in 5 years. But what a way to kickstart this re-union  huh?” Stig asked. 

“Sorry?” I said. 

“Your office assistant didn't tell you?! We got a reply to your comment. On the video.” Drew said. 

“Oh. Yeah.” I said. 

“Yeah. They said *‘You Were Not The Person Who Was Supposed To Find This. Please Do Not Share.'* ” Drew said.

""You freaked them out. They know we're on to them  Huck."" Stig said. ""Game on. That's what I say!""  
“That really sounds like it might be a dead end. I’m getting some drinks with co-workers if you want to come and hang for a bit?”

“No drinking for me. I talked to a few people. Carey K and her mom donated their bodies to science but they both got rejected. BIG TIME.” Stig said. 

“Yeah?” I said. 

“Yes. Because of suicide. Even lethal injections are a huge no-no in the medical community. So we’re going to drive and see if we find them. And maybe a few other little clues tonight since I'm not on call.” Stig said. 

I looked behind my shoulder. It was my boss. I don’t know how much he heard. But he looked at me with 70% less respect than he usually does. 

“Hop in. We’ve been at it all day.” Drew said.",HuckleberryExists,09-07-2020,False,False,False,False,False,7,0,0,,113,0
/r/nosleep/,nosleep,WHATEVER YOU DO  DON’T LEAVE THE BASEMENT,"I was sitting on the couch in the basement  scrolling mindlessly through the endless library of content on Netflix when the text came. It had been sent from an unknown number  and read:

*WHATEVER YOU DO  DON’T LEAVE THE BASEMENT. LOCK THE DOOR. TURN OFF THE LIGHTS. YOU ARE IN GRAVE DANGER. DO NOT LEAVE THE BASEMENT.*

At first  I thought it was a prank text. Some punk texting numbers at random  hoping to scare someone.

But at the same time  it was a little strange how they knew I was in my basement. After all  someone who was texting this to random numbers wouldn’t be able to tell if the person they were pranking even had a basement.

I inadvertently shot a quick glance at the small basement window. Nothing. Not a soul in sight.

I decided to ignore the message  figuring whoever it was had simply gotten lucky and had texted someone who happened to be in their basement. However  less than a minute later  I got another text:

*IT IS URGENT THAT YOU HEED THIS WARNING. CLOSE AND LOCK THE DOOR. TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS AND SILENCE ALL ELECTRONICS. AND WHATEVER YOU DO  DON’T LEAVE YOUR BASEMENT.*

I swallowed.

*Did they know I hadn’t shut my door? That I hadn’t turned off my lights?*

I was beginning to feel worried  but a quick glance at the window proved that no one was watching me. Or  at least  that no one was there now.

I stood up  turned off the big screen  and stretched. I decided to get a little sleep in before I had to go in for work that night. As I walked up the stairs  however  the texts started.

My phone began vibrating non-stop  receiving text after text after text. As I reached the top step  I pulled out my phone to see who they were from.

The texts had all come from that same unknown number  saying things like:

*DO NOT LEAVE YOUR BASEMENT.*

*IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU STOP MOVING RIGHT NOW AND TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS.*

*YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER. DO NOT MOVE.*

*PLEASE. THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. DO NOT LEAVE THE BASEMENT.*

*How the hell did they know I was moving?*

The basement doorway loomed in front of me  showing the dark expanse of my kitchen. I hadn’t realized that the sky had become overcast. I cautiously took a step into the kitchen. My phone buzzed again  but I ignored it. Whoever was texting had to be playing some sort of prank  though I wasn’t finding it very funny.

The floorboard creaked beneath my foot as I stepped out into the kitchen. Suddenly  a flash of lighting lit up the gray sky  and almost immediately  the rumble of thunder followed. I shivered  but continued to walk.

Then  I heard a loud creak. However  this time  it didn’t come from under my foot. In fact  it didn’t come from a floorboard at all.

This creak came from my door.

The sound was the unmistakable noise of the front door opening slowly  as if whoever was opening it was attempting to do it quietly.

As soon as the door opened  I got another text. I didn’t bother to get out my phone; just leaped down into my basement and closed the door. I locked it  then strung the chain  and even carried a heavy chair up to barricade the door  but I still didn't feel safe.

I carefully crept down the stairs and sat down on an old chair  pulling my phone out of my pocket to read the last few texts.

The first one read: *FOR GOD’S SAKE PLEASE DON’T LEAVE.*

The most recent one read: *NOW YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN. DO NOT TRUST ANYONE. AND DON’T LEAVE THE BASEMENT.*

*I’ve been chosen? What the hell does that mean?*

Finally  I did what I should have done in the first place. I texted the unknown number back.

*Listen  I don’t know what’s going on and I’m not sure that I want to find out. Please just leave me the hell alone. I don’t want to be a part of any of this.*

They didn’t respond.

Suddenly  I heard a sound coming from behind the basement door. A creak. The sound of pressure being placed upon a floorboard.

Then  I heard the sound of the doorknob being jiggled. I froze. It jiggled again. And again. Every small noise coming from beyond the locked door of the basement filled me with terror  paralyzing me with horror.

I looked around the small basement for anything that could remotely be considered a weapon. The room was  unfortunately  mostly empty  with the closest thing to a self-defense tool being the remote for the TV. I grabbed it and crouched down in the corner of the room.

My breathing felt too loud. My head felt like it was spinning. The cold basement seemed to close in around me.

I started imagining sounds. At least  I *thought* I was imagining them. I began hearing footsteps. Voices. Whispers. They echoed around me. I heard yells coming from outside my house. Then screams. Then silence. After what felt like an hour  the sounds stopped.

I breathed a sigh of relief. *Maybe it was all in my head after all.*

Then  I heard a knock on the basement window.

As previously mentioned  the basement window is small. In fact  I could barely see out of it. However  I was able to catch a glimpse of something outside darting past it. I mustered up every last drop of courage in me and weakly yelled:

“Who’s there?”

A few moments of silence followed  then a voice replied:

“Oh  just a traveler seeking shelter from the storm.” the voice sounded male  and somewhat strained  like he was speaking through gritted teeth.

*Who the hell would be out here in the middle of the rain?*

I live in a rural area in the middle of nowhere. I don’t have any neighbors  and the nearest grocery store is half an hour’s drive away. Something was wrong.

“I’m sorry...but I can’t let you in.”

“Why not?” the voice replied  this time a hint of anger in it.

I didn't reply. The texts and the sounds in my house seemed a little too real to be a part of some elaborate prank. Instead  I shifted a little to my right  just out of view from the window for anyone looking inside the house from the yard.

Thank God I did that  because a few seconds after I did  something leaned over and peered into the dark basement.

It’s impossible to describe the thing in the window  simply because I could hardly see it. The dust and dirt combined with the size of the window made it difficult to make out what was staring at me. All that I could see were two solid red eyes looking around inside my basement. Two small  black pupils glanced around  attempting to find me. I placed my head between my knees  and tried to steady my breathing.

It’s been 48 hours since then. I’ve been living off of the potato chips and energy drinks down in my basement. I’m running out  and I know soon  I’ll have to leave to get more food. I’ve spent the past couple of days sitting in the dark  listening to the sounds of footsteps and knocking on my doors. It’s maddening  but there’s nothing I can do.

I’ve tried calling the cops  and I’ve tried calling the place I work at.

I have a signal  but for some reason  it never works. No one ever picks up. I’m terrified  and I don’t know what to do.

I went to the bathroom for only a minute. That’s all.

I return to the breakfast table to see Natasha already eating  still seemingly unaware of what has happened to her hair. The table hosts a carton of cereal in its centre  my empty bowl and spoon by its side. 

Where’s my phone? I definitely left it here.

“Tash ” I hiss  careful for my uncle not to hear  “where’s my phone?”

She shrugs  barely looking up from the bowl of Coco Pops she’s lost herself in. My eyes scan the floor around my seat  around Natasha’s seat. Nothing. I definitely brought it down. It’s not in the bathroom  I remember leaving it on the table.

“Looking for something  Em?” my uncle chirps up behind me. I spin around  taken aback by how quietly he had snuck up on me.

“Uh – just my phone?” I say  “Have you seen it?”

“I don’t think so  not recently. Have some breakfast and then we can look together.”

As I eat my cereal  I feel my uncle’s eyes burning into the back of my head. He's watching me from his office.

\-

My phone is nowhere to be found. I KNOW I took it down to breakfast but I’m not sure where it could have gone. I think Uncle Curtis has taken it. 

Natasha hands me her phone and I quickly leave a voice recording to my parents.

*Mum  dad. It’s Emily. You NEED to come and pick us up. Something- something is happening here. Uncle Curtis he’s not who he says he is. He has a basement with dead people – or something… and he sneaks into our rooms at night and cuts our hair and nails. Please  mum come pick us up.*

I begin to quietly sob as I talk.

*Mum  dad  please. I’m so scared. So is Tash  we’re –*

Our bedroom door opens.

Uncle Curtis stands tall  his frame blocking the exit completely. He wears a smile  but something sinister lurks beneath.

“Emily?” he asks  “What are you doing?”

I’m frozen. I don’t know how to explain it  I just freeze. Fear overhauls my body. I feel nothing but fear.

“Emily. Are your parents on the phone?” He reaches his hand out and takes the phone from my now weak grasp. Upon staring at it for a second  he continues  “Ah  you’ve sent them a recording. May I play it  Emily?”

My mouth opens to speak; no words come out. His smile grows  but it is short-lived. Upon pressing play  his happy facade diminishes. He looks angry; a vein pops from the top of his head  his skin gets progressively redder. He throws the phone to the floor; it smashes upon impact.

“You fucking kids. You don’t understand anything  do you?” his teeth grit  “You don’t understand what *she* has given you all these years. What *she’s* going to give you soon.” 

With every ‘she’  he points to the ground as if 'she' were below us. Soon  his words become a shout.

“You FUCKING kids. Stop trying to RUIN THINGS.”

He grabs my hair and pulls it downward. I drop the my knees as pain sears through my scalp. I’m shocked by this  completely taken by surprise. But it is what happens next that throws me even more.

“LET GO OF HER!” Natasha screams.

The room falls silent. 

My uncle  still with a firm grasp on me  turns to face her and his smile returns.

“Well  well  well little one. She speaks ” he murmurs  “Like I said before  all you needed was a little… *push.”*

As he says this  he pushes my head back in a violent motion and I fall to the ground. The back of my skull bounces off the wooden flooring  dazing me. My vision is blurry; I try to regain my senses but the sudden movement and the blistering pain has made my blood rush. My head drops into my hands and I squeeze my eyes shut for a moment. As I look up  I see Uncle Curtis carrying Natasha over his shoulder and storming out of the bedroom. She screams and helplessly kicks her legs and punches his back.

“S-STOP!” I scream  “P-please  Uncle Curtis! Stop!” 

And he does. 

I don’t expect him to stop  but he stops dead in his tracks.

He turns to face me once more  the smile still plastered on his scorching red face.

“Uncle Curtis?” his roaring laugh fills the room  “Don’t you get it yet? I’m not your Uncle Curtis.”

His laugh bellows through the house as he turns with a skip in his step and walks out of the room. 

Not Uncle Curtis…? What? Then  who is he? 

What is he?

I stumble to my feet and manage a few steps before my vision starts to blur once more. I feel a thick liquid  trickle down my back; blood. It comes from my head - from where it had hit the floor. I continue to give chase  but by the time I’m at the top of the staircase  my vision begins to fade. 

Not even the sound of my uncle’s footsteps bounding back up the staircase below is enough to keep me conscious.

Not even the fear I feel as I see him turn the corner and smile with glee as he skips toward me is enough to keep me awake.

Not even the strong hand that grips the back of my neck and hauls me up onto his shoulders  as if I weighed nothing  is enough to stop everything fading to black.

\-

I wake in a dark room. It’s one I soon recognise as the room down the hatch; not the one with the cages  but the one before that.

I’m tied down to a chair  and I grunt as I weakly pull against the restraints to no avail.

I’m alone in the room  nothing has changed since Natasha and I were last down here. It’s just full of useless junk. I’m facing the ladder  and am unable to spin my head around to see the door that leads to the other room.

I cough. Droplets of blood spray from my mouth and disappear into the dark air before me. A few seconds later  I hear the door behind me open.

The sound of footsteps approach from behind; *click-clack  click-clack  click-clack.*

Two slender hands rest on my shoulders. They are not the same hands that had grabbed me by the neck  by the hair. They are not the hands of my uncle.

I feel a face lower down beside mine and whisper words directly into my ear.

“Hello  Emily ” a beautiful  soft-spoken woman’s voice cuts through the air like a knife through butter  “I am Orianne… and I am here to... [*change* you.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/squishycabbage/)",SquishyCabbage,09-06-2020,False,1599353446.0,False,False,False,14,1,1,,250,0
/r/nosleep/,nosleep,Tales From a Small Town: The two largest families in town hate each other,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark/comments/imzy2g/tales_from_a_small_town_if_a_stranger_wakes_up/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) | ""I don't care if it's a guy or a girl  but if it's a Lewis  you're not gonna put your dick in it "" I overheard Donovan tell Remmy. 

At the age of thirteen.

When you live in Raw  there are some things that are just common knowledge. The sun rises each morning  Mr Jones' liquor store opens at three in the afternoon  the Lamberts go fishing every Wednesday and the Bennetts hate the Lewises. 

When I first came here  I had no idea where this deeply rooted sentiment came from. I would hear Donovan go into angry tirades about this other family on an almost daily basis. At first I didn't dare to ask about them at all. Siobhan however eventually laid the whole story upon me. 

It appeared this feud had been going on for longer than any living member of either family could remember. I believe it started as a simple rivalry. Both the Bennetts and the Lewises had always been keeping orchards to guard their property and the borders of Raw from the creatures living in the mountains  they just took different approaches. While we have an apple orchard  they focus on shrubs with all sorts of berries. These bushes of theirs are so incredibly high in places that they are basically a wall of thorns  which is an arguably better protection than our rows of trees. The idea in itself is pretty smart  even Donovan is willing to admit as much  but the problem as he puts it is *that it was the Lewises' idea*.

Now  since I'm with the Bennetts and I love them dearly  you won't find me going behind their backs and talking to a Lewis  so I don't know how exactly they feel about the whole thing. They do try to slash the tires on Donovan's car at least once every other month though so I'm just going to take a wild guess here and say they don't like us either. To sum it up  we're the two largest families in town. Either of our properties border on the mountains  so the entire town of Raw lies between our two separate farms. For one  the residents trust us with keeping an eye out for any dangers coming from the mountains  however that also means that they're in the direct line of fire of our dispute.

These fights could take on minimal just as well as enormous proportions. For example  one time Vasily and I went dancing in one of the bars in town–for the record  we only have two bars. One is Dante's  the most popular place for everyone to meet up  and the other one is a college bar type of thing named Hoots. The majority of patrons there are younger folks who just want some music to move to and aren't necessarily there for the cheap drinks.

So we were in there just having a good time when out of nowhere  Rory Lewis showed up and called me a fatass. Of course  Vasily wanted to get back at him  but I didn't so I grabbed him by the arm and started to drag him outside. He tried to struggle but eventually gave in and confined himself to yelling something along the lines of  ""Least she got a pretty face! I'd hire Matilda to haunt a house!""

Matilda is Rory's sister and while I'm not one to put other girls down  Vasily has a point. Although I might just be saying that because she's a Lewis.

The thing about these smaller arguments is that it really messes up our families' flow on the few occasions that we're supposed to work together. Since either of us are keeping an eye out on either range flanking the town  communicating would make things a lot safer and easier. However since the only reason the Lewises venture out to our place is to key our vehicles and because the only times we ever call them on the phone is when we come up with some good new prank calls  it's safe to say neither party is very passionate about it.

The closest we ever got to one another was probably three years ago.

It all started with Donovan  Vasily  me and a bag of dogshit. We set out under cover of night  taking turns in carrying the bag  each of us holding it as far away from our noses as possible. In there were the combined feces of three large guard dogs; it was basically Pandora's box but with odor instead of plagues. This little gift was meant for the Lewises  or rather the Lewises' car to be exact. It had begun with them spray painting a very crude depiction of male genitalia on the hood of Donovan's car  and now he was out for revenge.

We quietly made our way over to the other side of town. The streets were dark and empty and there were only a few lights on in some random windows. Most residents had already gone to bed hours ago. My eyes swept past the town hall–the large building stood out imposingly  almost threateningly against the night sky. A queasy feeling was beginning to grow in my stomach  but I forced it down. This was about our honor as a family; a challenge that demanded satisfaction–or in this case  crap under the car hood of an old  mean grouch. 

Fortunately for us  the Lewises kept their dogs in a backyard separate from the front of the house where their vehicles stood  which meant it was unlikely we would alert them. So there we were  finally. 

""Gloves "" Donovan ordered in a low voice. Vasily nodded and reached into his pocket  proceeding to pull out the pair of gardening gloves we had ""borrowed"" from Siobhan. Donovan pulled them on with a deadpan look on his face before making his way up to old Ted Lewis's blue truck. After some fumbling  he managed to get the hood up and waved us closer. I could see him lick his lower lip in excitement  his eyes faintly twinkling.

""Now the crap."" 

I wordlessly opened the bag for him  suppressing a gag once the odor emanating from it reached my nose. Donovan  utterly stoic  reached inside with both hands. We could hear a loud splat as the dogs' feces landed in the dark space underneath the hood. Donovan quickly and quietly pressed it shut again and marched over to the back of the car  bending down to reach the tailpipe. He grabbed a handful of shit again and shoved it up the tailpipe as best he could. 

He straightened up with a satisfied smirk on his face  offering both of his hands to us for a high five  but we told him it wasn't going to happen before he'd taken off the gloves. 

""Hey kids "" he suddenly spoke up. We were already getting ready to book it but something appeared to be bothering him. ""Is it just me or is it quieter around here tonight?""

""What do you mean?"" Vasily asked  raking a hand through his jetblack hair. Donovan's tone was enough to have both of us feeling uneasy. 

""This ain't the first time I've been around the Lewises' at night. These folks don't train their dogs right. Or at all  probably.""

He was right. The Lewises' dogs are some moody little bitches  always looking for trouble and barking at anything that moves. ""You think something's wrong?"" I offered. 

Donovan reached up to tug on his lower lip  a telltale sign of nervousness of his. Thankfully  I could stop him before he could do so. ""The crap "" I reminded him in a low hiss. 

""Oh  right "" he muttered  letting out a relieved chuckle. ""You're a good kid  Peps. Can't believe I'm actually getting worked up over the Lewises' dogs of all things. Come on  you two  let's get moving.""

""Wait "" Vasily chimed in  ""I think we should check in on the dogs. It'll only take a second and it's kinda crucial after all. It's enough if one of us just goes around back real quick. Don't have to be all of us."" 

""I'll go "" I suggested hurriedly. ""I won't be long  just check if those beasts are dead or not and we'll be on our way.""

""Stay low "" my father advised me and I nodded  ducked down and proceeded to rush around the corner of the Lewises' large house. It had some resemblance with our own  except that I like to think ours is a lot nicer. The same style and roughly the same size too though. Unlike us  they don't let their dogs simply run around and sleep in their yard. Instead  they built a large cage in the back of their property for them to do so  which in a way was practical since they were always closer to the mountains. 

Upon arriving in front of the fenced area  I instantly spotted three figures lying motionless on the ground. Their silhouettes stood out in the gray darkness. At first  I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong with them–there was something wrong for sure  I could see *that* much  but it took me another few seconds of staring until I realized that they weren't asleep. I get that all dogs sleep in different positions and while ours have always liked to curl up  I've seen them flat and stretched out before too. What I've never seen was any dog lying as stiff as these. They were completely soundless too–the night was quiet  yet I couldn't seem to hear any heavy breaths  little grunts or sleep-whimpers from them. 

I could feel my fingers quivering ever so slightly as I reached into my pocket to take out my phone. Turning on its flashlight and pointing it at the dogs on the ground  I instantly started to gag and before I could pull myself together  I bent over and threw up into the dirt. Breathing heavily  I straightened up again  spitting a few more times to get rid of the taste of vomit in my mouth. 

I could hear hurried footsteps approaching from where I'd left Vasily and Donovan  only to find both of them running towards me. I simply pointed at the cage  trying to avoid looking at it again. My brother couldn't say a word but Donovan managed to force out a quiet curse as he laid eyes upon what I'd discovered. 

The dogs' bellies had been slit open  their innards laid exposed. Their tongues were hanging from their open snouts. 

""Who did this?"" I whimpered  pressing up against my brother's chest and hiding my face in his jacket. 

""Kids… I think we need to check inside "" our father muttered. We exchanged worried glances. There were only a few reasons why somebody would kill a family's guard dogs. Perhaps they were what had been stopping them from making their way inside their house. As we made our way up the Lewises' porch  we found it open just a crack. Donovan  who had his bowie knife on him as always  readied it on his belt. 

""You think I should run and grab your shotgun?"" Vasily offered. 

""No time "" he replied. ""It'll be enough though. There's three of us. Be careful  you two."" With that  he pushed against the door and it swung open with a loud  drawn-out creak. There was not a single light on inside. We took a few hesitant steps into the darkness.

""Lewis?"" Donovan called out  his firm voice masking his unease. 

No reply.

We made our way through an empty hallway I had never seen before and I stifled a gasp when I bumped into what must have been a small cabinet or something. We didn't have to go too far to find our rival family though. 

It was the dimly flickering light of an oil lamp that drew up towards them. We found them in their kitchen  all set around their large table like they were about to take in a meal  despite there not being a single glass or plate. There were the parents Ted and Aster  Rory and Matilda and even the three younger members of the clan  Sven  Hazel and Melissa. None of them were moving and at first  I thought for sure they were dead. All of them had their eyes wide open  looking glazed and empty  and all of them were facing the single source of light; the oil lamp in the middle of the table. 

It was only when I caught young Hazel blink that I realized they were in fact still alive. I let go of a relieved sigh only to tense up again. What was going on here? Of course  it was Donovan who first dared to raise his voice. He began by clearing his throat  but received no response whatsoever. 

""Ted?"" he then spoke up  addressing the silent patriarch. 

Ted Lewis's oily graying hair was hanging down into his face  making him look even more ghostly than his blank stare already was. His wife sat across from him and when I took a step around the table to get a better look at her  I found her to be just as still and frozen as Ted. The scowl which I was accustomed to seeing on Matilda's face had faded and she was gazing at the burning flame as vacantly as her siblings and parents.

""I'm scared "" I uttered breathlessly  glancing over at Donovan. It was the easiest  most simplistic and yet also the most honest way I could describe what I was feeling.

Donovan reached for my hand and gave it a gentle squeeze before stepping up to Ted Lewis. He slowly waved his hand in front of his face  trying to get a reaction. He then rested his large palm on the old man's shoulder  prodding it slightly. I rounded the table to get over to Hazel. Her tan skin seemed to glow in the eerie warm light  her large brown eyes remaining wide open as I leaned over to face her. The young girl had always been the kindest of the bunch. She'd even tried to talk to Carol once when I was with her. Both my sister and I were really surprised at her approach  pleasantly of course  but before the girls had the chance to exchange more than a few words  Aster had showed up and called her daughter back to her side  seeming rather angry.

""We gotta get them outside "" Donovan murmured before lifting his head. ""Pepper  go back to the orchard and bring back one of our dogs. And hurry. We need to keep this side of the town covered somehow as long as they're out.""

I nodded and instantly sprinted out the door and off into the direction of our home. I'm not in perfect shape  but I've always been a good runner  so I managed to get back to our house in around twenty minutes. I chose to bring Hades with me to the Lewises' orchard. He was already close to my heart back then and generally very sharp and alert. He looked very confused upon finding me slipping into his cage and quietly calling him  but willingly came trotting towards me. He happily ran alongside me as we took off  probably excited to be taken on a surprise walk. 

When we arrived  we found Donovan and Vasily standing over the members of the Lewis family  all of which either sitting or lying completely motionless on the ground. Vasily was just wiping the unresponsive patriarch's forehead with what looked like a wet cloth  but to no avail. Upon noticing me and the dog  my father came up to me.

""You got Hades  eh? Good call. Listen  Peps  your brother and I need to get these guys to the doctor. Got the keys for their other truck from inside. I trust you  so I need you to stay here and look out for the mountains until the sun goes up. Shouldn't be long now and we'll come back to get you as soon as we've explained everything to the doc anyways  but if you don't want to  I get that. You can come with me and Vasily can stay here instead if that's what you want.""

I shook my head. ""I'll be fine. Not on my own after all."" I gestured towards Hades. ""Just make it quick  alright?""

""Will do. One more thing. If something from the mountains should come  don't try to fight it. I found Lewis's shotgun and put it out on the chair on the porch for you  but that's just if everything should go wrong. In case Hades does notice something and it's not too late yet  go hide inside. It's safer."" 

I told him I'd be careful and quickly grabbed the gun before rounding the house and sitting down with my back leaning against the fence of the cage the dead dogs were still in. Hades was sniffing the air and trotting to and fro in front of the cage. I tried to keep him from freaking out by calling him to my side and petting him  telling him it was okay. We spent what felt like an eternity watching the mountain range from afar and I was grateful for every minute that went by in silence. I feared that any second  Hades would pick up something coming down to us and start barking. The thought of the mangled corpses of the dogs in the cage behind me was gnawing on my mind and my head was running wild with images of the creatures from the hills. 

And yet  I could only sit and wait  my dog's comforting warmth by my side and my heart pounding in my chest. 

As the first tender rays of sunlight pushed their way through the jagged stone walls protruding from the desert and encircling the small town  I could hear the Lewises' truck  driven by Donovan and Vasily  pull up in front of the house. I got up  trying not to look into the cage behind me  and went to greet them.

""It's been quiet  thank God "" I told them. Vasily let out a sigh of relief. ""So what did the doc say?""

The look on Donovan's face darkened. ""It looks sorta like they've been poisoned. He said some stuff about their pupils being dilated and their blood pressure being off so it'd point to some kind of drug. Now  I doubt getting high and staring at a lamp is some regular family activity for them."" He cleared his throat. ""Tricky thing is  an attack on one of the border properties means an attack on Raw. Doc said it was either us  but probably not since we helped them  or somebody tried to get them to drop their guard so the beasts could get into town.""

""But wasn't that a bit of a sloppy job then?"" I argued. ""If I were to take down Raw's defenses  I'd focus on both border orchards equally.""

""That's the thing "" Vasily chimed in. ""It looks like someone set out on a mission here but abandoned it halfway through. Doc already said he'd tell the mayor so there's gonna be a town meeting soon. I was thinking it might have been… you know."" He shot Donovan a grim look. I knew who he meant. He's careful not to drop that name when I'm present though.

Thankfully  our father immediately shook his head. ""Leslie Torres is Old Scratch incarnate  but no. This ain't Leslie's doing.""

I tried not to look as relieved as I was about this. Donovan is usually right about these things. The town meeting was held a few days later but no one had very much to contribute. I suggested we'd try to get a hold of the Sheriff–maybe he'd seen someone suspicious. Nothing ever came of it though and after another month or so  the incident had faded from the residents' minds. The Lewises recovered and in the week they needed to get new dogs  we had Eden over at their orchard to keep watch. And that was that. It's odd how these things just happen sometimes.

/r/nosleep/,nosleep,We Found The Youtube Channel of A Classmate Who Died In A Car Accident,"It’s sad when the only former high school classmate you see is your drug dealer.Most of our nerd table at the lunchroom became lawyers  doctors  tech executives. 

Except for Drew.Dealing drugs is just one of his jobs. He bartends at weddings. Buys junker cars and takes them to Mexico to flip for a few grand. 

He lives in a Mercedes Sprinter outside of San Diego. 

Usually he leaves my normal order in the garden without saying ‘hi’. Tonight he asked if I could meet him in person. I know he doesn’t profit off my orders. So I drove down after closing up shop early. 

Drew’s dad is a lawyer. His brother is a lawyer. I am a lawyer. I also take a prescription for provigil. And sometimes microdose psilocybin mushrooms. Because I have my own family issues. 

“How’s the trial going?” Drew asks. 

“The client has lied to us the entire time. But we picked a jury that would ride or die with him.” I smirked. 

“Well at least he’ll learn a valuable lesson from all of this.” Drew replied. 

He looked around the area. Opened up his glove compartment and handed me my bag. 

“I’m probably not going to be taking any tonight  but I don’t mind if you want to get high and hang.” I said. 

“Actually I wanted to pick your brain on something. And it’s better if you’re not high when I mention any of this.” he said. 

“If it’s legal advice you better have given me good shit.” I replied. 

“No. I mean I don’t think it is.” he said. 

“Do you remember Carey K Rothwell?” Drew asked. 

I leaned back in my chair. I knew he didn’t have the proper way to word that question. The apology filled his eyes before he could give it. 

“Yeah. I mean. You know I was there  right?” I said. 

“Truthfully. I don’t remember that night at all.” Drew said. 

“You were there though.” I replied. 

It was after a soccer game. Carey K Rothwell was a cute girl. Bubbly but a bit of a loner. There were so many Kari  Carey  Kerrys in her class she went by Carey K. The sad thing is that she didn’t travel with a pack of other girls with her. Always seemed to have a new friend each semester.  She played on the girls soccer team as a junior.  Went to the boys games every fall. Two of our friends were in the band. I was writing for the paper.  We were all driving to get some fast food when Carey K’s car was spotted on the road. 

She had hit a deer.  Or to be specific. The deer hit her. Her Jeep Cherokee smashed so hard into it that its head was decapitated. And it smashed right into Carey K. Killing her. 

I pulled over. It had been probably 4 or 5 minutes after the crash. Other cars pulled over. Cops came. Neighbors walked blocks to see it. 

Drew was in the car with me that night. He didn’t even get out to help Carey K. He just muttered that she was dead and we shouldn’t even get out. I knew he had a crush on her. But in a way where they weren’t in each others circles. And it wouldn’t have worked out. 

She and I had never talked. But I knew of her. Mostly because her mom was one of my favorite teachers at school. 

I went to look. Just to make sure what I thought wasn’t wrong. The deer head was in the backseat. Its body underneath the back tires. Carey K’s hands still tied to the wheel. 

“Are the memories bothering you? Want to talk about it?” I asked Drew. 

“So I found her Youtube page.” Drew replied. 

“What?” I said. 

“Yeah. Ummm.  She had a screenname on AOL. MilhousesGoldfish84.” he said. 

“*Where’s the Bowl Bart*?!” I quoted.

“Heh. Canine’s Mutiny. One of my Top 10 episodes.” He replied. 

“Anyways. I sort of think about her every now and then. And it hit me that maybe she had used that username on a forum or had a blog with it…” Drew said. 

“And you found a Youtube page?” I asked. 

He nodded. 

There were 8 videos. He clicked on a random one. 

“Holy crap. That’s her.” I said. 

The videos felt more like home movies than Youtube content. Like finding someone’s roll of vacation film and not seeing anything interesting at all. But soaking in the melancholy of it all.

“This one is better.” Drew said. 

*He clicked on one of her in the woods. She seemed to be walking around and filming birds.* 

*“What would people think if they knew that my mom taught religious studies at a Catholic school but was really into Aleister Crowley?”* 

*The next part of the video had her inside of a crypt. Whistling. As if looking for a dog.*

*“What would people think if they knew that my first communion was from the Beast and not a Priest?”* 

“Is this one of those Blair Witch knockoffs everyone was trying to make?” I laughed. 

“Hold on.” Drew said. Fast forwarding twenty minutes into the forty minute video.She was back in the woods. 

*“Hey there. Hey there. I’m not here to hurt you.”  Carey K said.* 

Walking through the woods was a young deer. Carey K sang a song. To be specific it sounded more like someone trying to sing while hiccuping. 

“*I’m not here to hurt you. No. You’re going to hurt me  okay?”* Carey K said. 

The deer came closer. And closer. Then it nervously bowed to her. 

“*No. Not today. When we’re both older. Let’s try to enjoy the time we have in these bodies”* 

*She positioned the camera on the ground. And hugged the deer.* 

*“You’re scared of dying aren’t you?” she whispered to the der.* 

*“I am too.  Can we cry together?” She began crying. The deer began to shudder as she put her arm around it.* 

*“See we have to die so we can instruct the others how to get into the Nightmare Room.”* 

“What the fuck is this  Drew.” I said. 

“One more.” he said. 

“I should get going.” I said. 

But he clicked on it and held my arm down. 

It was Carey K riding the deer. Like it was a horse. At night.

“Do you know where that street is?” he asked.

“It’s where she died.” I said. 

“I wanted to make sure.” he said. 

“Drew. You do realize that…” 

“Go ahead and say it.” he said. 

“She died in 2000. Seven or eight years before Youtube was even a website.” I said. 

“I know.” he said. “These videos didn’t even get uploaded until 2014.”

“Who uploaded this?” I said. 

“Maybe her mom?” he said. 

“She died. Our freshman year of college. I went to her funeral.” I said. 

“How did I not know that?” he asked. 

“Because it was a suicide.” I said.

“Whoever uploaded this knew her by her screen name. And somehow they got these videos and uploaded it as her after her death. But why?” he asked. ",HuckleberryExists,09-06-2020,False,1599298829.0,False,False,False,111,0,0,,5027,0
/r/nosleep/,nosleep,Disappearing Act," 

I don’t think I’ll ever forget that day. That day almost 90 people just disappeared right in front of me  and I think I’m the only one who remembers them.

Let me start from the beginning. It was  what I thought was  a normal day. I woke up  got ready to leave for the gym  my make-shift gym bag  which was really just an old backpack filled with gym clothes  in hand. I walked down to the train station  like always  I sat in the uncomfortable chair  away from the crowds  like always  I people-watched so I knew what people I might have to deal with for the ride  like always. It was so mundane  it almost felt tedious  I’d done it so much. 

While on the train  right next to the door  I examined the people in the line of sight. A man in a suit  I believe a salary-man  was next to me. He seemed tired  bored  like he wanted more in his life  or maybe that’s just the daydreamer in me. There was a girl  oddly dressed  just on her phone  closest to the door. Lastly a blonde guy  he seemed like the joking type. While crossing my arms over my bag  I noticed the blonde was gesturing to someone outside. I turned my head and noticed a girl getting ready to take a picture. I held back a smile  or tried to at least  while she did. I had seen many ditsy college students  aspiring to be photographers  taking pictures of anything that’ll catch their eyes.

The doors close as the blonde laughs quietly. The train starts moving as I zone out looking out the window  watching the walls fly by. It was about half way through the ride when the power went out. We were in a dark tunnel  so no one could see anything. A high-pitched ringing started  it was quiet at first then got louder and louder; like it was getting closer. It got to the point where I was hunched over  covering my ears. I fell back  still covering my ears  and started screaming. It suddenly stopped right before I thought my ear drums were going to explode. I got up slowly  breathing heavily  straining my eyes to try  desperately  to see anything at all. 

The lights finally stitch on  blinding me for a few moments. Blinking away the bright white  everything starts to fade in slowly. Well almost everything. 

The train was there  the seats were there  I was there  everything was there  except the 90 or so people who were with me on that train. I looked around frantically  but nobody was there. I couldn’t believe it  I still don’t. The intercom came on with the conductor apologizing for the power outage. At least I wasn’t trapped completely alone  no way to get out. The train comes to a stop  finally  I’m shaking as I get out. I looked at the crowd that was waiting for the train. They each looked confused  some concerned  as this time of day is always busy. 

I move past people  running up the stairs  out of the station. I decided to skip the gym that day and ran straight home. Which is where I’ve been for the past three days. I don’t know what to do. I’ve scoured the internet for any answer possible  news stories  missing persons posts  but nothing is showing up. It’s like no one remembers them  and I didn’t even see 99% of them. I wish I knew who that college photographer was but I can’t find her either. I’ve messaged all the colleges in that area  but  after being provided a list of students who would match my description  she wasn’t there either. 

I just can’t live not knowing what happened to them  I need to find those people.",gay_as_fuck_01,09-06-2020,False,False,False,False,False,16,0,0,,289,0
/r/nosleep/,nosleep,I guard a weed farm. We’re under attack.,"I’ve worked security all my life. Mostly clubs  events  shops and other things like that. Never anything like this  nothing illicit.

I was offered the job by a regular big spender at the club I was guarding  known only as Crash  a serious guy with fingers in all kinds of illegal pies.

It was rumoured the name came from his drug dealing empire and the slew of enemies that had fallen victim to mysterious car accidents. I asked him about it once at the door and the guy stopped  looked me dead in the eyes and told me he loved Crash Bandicoot. 

We had a good rapport after that. Crash liked me; he said that there weren’t many people out there with big enough balls to ask that question. We got on well and for all his faults I found him to be a stand up guy. 

He asked me if I’d consider working security for him last week. I turned him down at first  made it clear I didn’t want to be a part of anything violent. He talked me round with promises of a quiet job on a farm  fending off hapless stoners.

It was only pot. I liked to partake myself on occasion  I’d never been into the heavy shit but I did enjoy a smoke. Spending all night watching some plants up a mountain seemed pretty innocuous. It sounded more peaceful than the club scene and it paid a hell of a lot better too. 

At the time I thought it was a no brainer but now I’m really starting to regret my life choices.

Crash gave me coordinates to find the place and told me I’d be met by a guy called Beau  my new coworker. The drive was gorgeous  out past fields and into the mountains  the sun just falling slowly behind them. 

I took a sunken  grassy turning into a small opening where three other cars were parked right at the foot of the mountain and pulled up. Three men  stood leaning against a silver fiesta  stopped talking to glare at me. They were a motley bunch  none of them really resembling any of the security guards I’d worked with before. 

“Can we help you?” Asked a short  rotund man with a long  wiry beard that bounced as he spoke. He craned  his neck to look up at me  his brow was furrowed and his tone disdainful.

“I’m looking for Beau  I was sent by Crash.”

A thin  twiggy looking young guy  with a long mop of hair and a demeanour much friendlier than the bearded one stood up straight and took a step towards me  goofy smile plastered across his face. He looked no older than eighteen. 

“The new guy! Welcome! Don’t mind Travis  he’s not so trusting.” He scoffed in the direction of the bearded guy  who was still scowling and the third  quiet man who remained leant against the fiesta  not taking much note of my presence at all. “Beau Grackle here  ready for duty! Your name is?” 

“Mooky.” I stretched out a hand to shake my new colleagues’. 

“What a name! Nice to meet you Mooky. This is Travis and Grant  they’re the day guys.” Beau gestured to the two others once more and the quiet guy  who was 
slightly taller but just as grouchy looking as his colleague  turned and spoke impatiently  twiddling car keys in his hand.

“This is great and all. But as he said  we’re the day guys and I’ve just finished my shift. I’m going home. Good luck out there newbie  I’ll learn your name if you’re still here tomorrow.” Grant nodded politely but solemnly and got in his vehicle before I could answer  Travis not far behind. I noticed a large patch of what looked like *dried blood* on his sleeve as he pulled the drivers side door shut. 

I was left with Beau  and the inference that I might not be around in the morning.

“What did he mean?” I asked nervously. 

“Oh Grant? He’s just a joker! Don’t worry! Come with me!” 

Beau spoke with a perpetual niceness that I was already finding grating  his enthusiasm reminded me of a kid  excited to show his friend all his new toys from Christmas. 

As we walked a thin  winding trail the sun set  dusk kissed the mountain and I tried to push my annoyance to the back of my mind. No matter what  the picturesque mountain was a better view than drunken folk in the gutter.

The walk totalled about forty five minutes. It was a trek  but I suppose a giant pot farm had to be something you’d struggle to stumble across. We reached a thick brush that Beau jovially pulled me through as twigs and branches cut into my skin. And then there we were. 

“Isn’t she beautiful!” 

It certainly was. I could understand Beau’s affection for the farm. Hundreds  maybe thousands of plants were all lined up in rows  stretching a huge patch of mountain. They danced in the faint breeze  setting off incredible waves of foliage. 

Just the other side of the brush  backed against it were two fold out camping chairs. 

“All set up! See  perfect! Time to settle in for the night Mooky. I bought snacks and even better..” Beau rustled in his pocket before plopping himself on one of the camping chairs and proudly holding up a slightly flattened  mangled spliff. 

“Whats the deal? Do we just sit here all night?” I asked  perching myself on the other seat and lighting up a cigarette  ignoring his teen sleepover behaviour. 

“Well  mostly yes. There are some things to look out for  I’m sure Crash filled you in. Stoners  police  rival sellers  pests  mountain creatures  the Oostelfeik  giant slugs-“

“What?!”

Beau took in my confusion and lifted a hand to his face in despair as his smile dropped for the first time. He stamped his feet on the ground like some kind of demented little elf  or that same child he was earlier  after his friend broke the toys. 

“Crash didn’t say anything did he?! That man. Does this every goddamn time... I’m going to give him such a piece of my mind.  Didn’t he learn from Ren?” 

“Who’s Ren? What are you talking about? What is an Oostelfeik?!” 

Beau exhaled seemingly every bit of air in his body  deflating like a balloon as he sunk back into his chair.

“Ren was the last guy Crash sent me  he was unprepared too and he succumbed to the fucking slugs of all things. Crash had *me* call his wife  poor woman was devastated. 

“This patch of mountain Mook  it ain’t as safe as you might imagine. Other things share the space and we have to look out for them. The occasional human invaders are the least of our concerns. That’s the short version  in good time you’ll see it for yourself  but if you want to live you’ll listen to me and stay alert.”

I tried to take in what he was saying  but Beau resembled a teenaged shaggy from scooby do and the mangled spliff he was suckling on as he spoke about giant slugs made it hard to take him seriously. Was this a babysitting job? Was I here to look after this guy? I knew I was going to be having serious words with Crash.

“It’s Mooky.” I answered firmly  before struggling to hold in a laugh as I continued. “And you expect me to believe I’m at risk of death by slug? Pass the joint  man.” I took it out of his hand and took a long drag then exhaled. 

Beau looked crushed at my laughter. I felt guilty  even if I didn’t  he really did believe what he was saying. The disappointment on his face made that apparent. 

A few hours passed mostly in silence  we shared the spliff and watched the plants dance  dusk became night and Beau pulled out a tiny wind up light that needed recharging every fifteen minutes or so. 

There wasn’t a great deal of conversation  Beau knew I didn’t believe a word he said and he wasn’t prepared to continue trying to convince me  so I focused on the light. Counting how many times it turned off was how I passed the time. 

I thought about the money I was making  the ease of the job and the glorious lack of drunk people. It made me want to make the best of things  so I tried to humour Beau and make him feel a little special. If things went well I guessed I’d be spending quite some time with him.

“You never answered my question man  what is an Oostelfeik?”

Grumpy and arms crossed  Beau turned and scoffed. 

“So you’re ready to listen now are you? Or do you just want to mock the crazy guy?”

“I’m ready to listen  I promise.” It wasn’t entirely the truth but I *was* bored stiff and I wasn’t going to mock him after. It wasn’t my style  I felt bad enough for doing it the first time. Beau sighed heavily again  at this stage I wasn’t sure how there was still air in his body.

“The Oostelfeik is something that lives in the woodland just beyond the farm. We don’t see it often  no one does. It only ever emerges when it’s hungry.”

I looked out towards the horizon of trees that towered over the field of weed as he continued.

“There’s plenty of small animals in the forest for it but every now and again the thing likes a bigger treat. It’s claimed more than a few coworkers. That’s why I keep this.” 

Beau’s childlike grin creeped back onto his face as he reached into the inner layer of his coat  through a hole in the stitching  and pulled out a hand gun  swinging it round in circles.

My heart started to pound. I worked security  but I’d never seen an actual gun before. I expected Crash to have them  but I didn’t expect Shaggy to have one hanging out in his jacket. And it was used to attack some strange mountain creature? I wasn’t sure he was stable enough to be in possession of such a weapon  but he was. So I didn’t say a word  just held my breath and played along.

“What does it look like?” I asked.

“It’s disgusting Mook  it’s about the size of a large dog  got these little deformed limbs that move so quickly  six of them. A jaw that stretches its entire face like some fucked up version of zippy from rainbow... and no eyes.” 

Pushing aside my surprise that Beau was old enough to know what rainbow was and also the deep annoyance that he’d shortened my name again  I took notice of the expression in his eyes as he talked about the Oostelfeik’s lack of. He was welling up  a fear in them that was incredibly convincing. It made me truly uncomfortable. 

As I readied myself to ask another barrage of questions there was a rushing sound coming from between the plants. It wasn’t the sound of wind  something was moving through them. Palms sweaty  I stood up  trying to catch a glimpse in the light. 

“Stand back Mook. I’ll handle this!” Beau leapt up throwing and outstretched arm in front of me and skipped into the farm  stroking the plants with one hand and waving his gun with the other.

“SHOW YOURSELF MOTHERFUCKER!” 

Beau’s voice changed as he screamed into the endless rows of plants. The weedy  cheerful kid became genuinely intimidating as he bellowed. I followed from a distance holding the wind up light and my phone torch  concerned and curious. Was this what Crash had hired him for? As a teenage stoner  I’d have run for my life at that voice. I imagined it was quite an effective scare tactic. 

Closing the distance between Me and Beau  I noticed two figures just ahead of him  running around in the gaps between the plants. 

“Little shits.” He muttered under his breath as I caught up with him. 

“What are they?” I asked  kicking myself for buying into his paranormal obsession. As much as I hated to admit it  I could feel something more in the air. Maybe it was the kind of mystic feeling you get in the mountains or maybe a sign of something much worse. 

The figures darted around the foliage  never hovering in a place where my light shone long enough for me to actually catch a glimpse. Instead I just heard the giggling  echoing through the night sky  the laughter of children. I looked at my phone and we’d hit midnight  the moon was creating an eerie purple glow with smatterings of stars. 

“Are they kids?! Are there fucking kids here man? What do we do?” 

I started to freak out  logically  even without Beau’s otherworldly explanations  kids running through a pot farm in the dead of night wasn’t a good sign. It also wasn’t the kind of thing that came up in training or in any of my other security jobs. I cursed myself for taking up Crash’s offer  I was way out of my depth.

Then they stopped moving.

Two kids  no older than eight or nine sat cross legged on the floor  giggling as they played some kind of clapping game with each other. Maybe patty cake  I don’t know  I was far to confused to pay attention. One girl and one boy  who closely resembled one another and had to be siblings. I stuttered a few times but Beau interjected.

“They aren’t children Mook. Don’t let them fool you  these are the pests I was talking about.”

*Pests.* Did he just call two kids lost in the wilderness pests? 

The slightly older looking girl stood up and started to half skip towards us  springing and giggling.

“DON’T COME ANY CLOSER!” Beau bellowed again  chilling my spine with his tone. 

The girl didn’t flinch  neither did her brother  he sat on the ground unbothered as she burst into hysterical laughter... cackling even. She threw her head back and clutched her stomach as if she had just seen the most hilarious thing imaginable. Creeped out  I edged backwards slightly.

After a few moments of the echoing laughter and Beau standing his ground I realised the once little girl was now towering above him... above me even. I lowered my eyes to her feet  which were levitating about a metre of the ground and gasped. 

“What the fuck Beau?” 

Beau looked at me and grinned. “I told you you’d see.” He bragged  realising I could no longer deny his claims that something was seriously fucking wrong. He raised his gun and turned his head to face the little girl  pointing it directly in her face.

“No!” I screamed. 

“She isn’t a kid Mook. Remember that.” 

Beau stared at her coldly as he pulled the trigger and she hit the ground  dropping a significant distance from her floating position. The bullet hold was perfectly circular. No expected spatter or brains or anything. A huge lump formed in my throat. Regardless of how obvious it may have been that the kids weren’t kids she still looked like a dead *kid* on the floor. Despite the lack of blood. 

I looked away in horror and noticed her younger brother tearing at the plants around him  making use of the attention being on his sister. Instinctively I did the only thing I could and walked towards him  intending to guard what I’d been hired to and usher him off of the farm. Get him away from the gun. Away from Beau.

“Don’t do it Mook. You don’t know what your messing with. I’m warning you...” 

I was entranced  totally shaken by what I’d witnessed I edged closer and closer to the boy... or not a boy... desperate to help him. As I got within a few inches he started to change. 

His face morphed and his teeth elongated  meeting a perfectly sharp point  his skin greyed and black veins started protruding from his face. He hunched over on all fours and braced himself for launch. 

Foaming at the mouth  the small boy sprung up into the air and hurled towards me  barely visible in the shadows as I dropped the phone face down in fear and the charge on the light ran out  leaving us all in the dark. 

*BANG* 

A loud shot came from the side of me and the hideous creature just a few millimetres from my face dropped to the ground with a thud. Just like the other one had. I heard the whirring of the handle on the torch and was mildly blinded as Beau fired it back up  revealing the two bodies on the floor.

“You said you were going to listen to me. You were about to be killed!” He started shouting  back in the mode of a petulant child. 

“What the fuck was that?” 

“No time. We need to move them before they wake up.” He grabbed hold of the girls ankles and started to drag her through the plants  towards the woodland on the horizon. “Come on! Follow me. Or die. Your choice.”

I grabbed the boy’s ankles  cringing as we pulled the not children along the muddy path. I struggled to believe at first that they weren’t completely and utterly dead  but sure enough in the dim moonlight glow their chests rose and fell rhythmically with breath. My hands shook  struggling to grip.

“We encounter these guys quite often. Common pests of this land  frightening  sure. But there are far worse things beyond the trees and eventually all of them come out to play. 

“If you aren’t cut out for this then go home in the morning and don’t come back. I don’t want to be calling your wife too.”

“Boyfriend.” I answered Beau’s rant  still dragging the surprisingly heavy creature. 

“What’s the lucky guys name?” 

“Alistair.”

“Well I don’t want to make that call to Alistair. So please  make a decision.” 

We reached the vanishing point  where the trees met the lush green pot plants and the gaps between the branches created terrifying shadows that I was certain were moving. Beau let go of the girls ankles and she flopped to the ground  I followed suit.

“Let’s go back  we need to clear some ground so they don’t follow when we get up.” 

We trudged back through the plants silently. It was uncomfortable  just like our walk to the farm from the cars had been. I felt kinda bad for not listening to my new colleague. Granted  his presentation of the issue wasn’t great but there was no denying that he was right. Human visitors would’ve been nothing in comparison. 

About halfway he stopped and told me to turn around. We turned just in time to watch the two not kids stand up  dust themselves off and skip off into the trees. As if nothing happened. As if neither of them had fucking bullets in their brains. 

Do monsters have brains?

A few birds flew out from the canopy  masking the stars in the sky. I took in the surroundings  breathed in the fresh air and made a decision.

“I’ll be here tomorrow Beau. I should have listened. I’m sorry.”

He smiled  like he’d just woken up to that mountain of toys on Christmas. We talked  walked and enjoyed another spliff together by the brush. The sunrise was gorgeous  the type of uninterrupted view that no other job was going to provide. 

An alarm rang from Beau’s pocket. 

“Shifts over Mook! Time to hand it back to Travis and Grant. Come on!” 

The tiredness was starting to hit me and I stood up in preparation for the hike down the mountain  itching to get to bed. Just before turning to climb back through the brush I took one last look at the tree line on the horizon.

That’s when I saw it.

Beau had been right. It was the size of a large dog or wolf with multiple twisted appendages coming from its body  it’s mouth splitting it’s face perfectly in two  just visible in the distance. [I could swear it looked right at me before retreating.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/)

/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,Coronavirus Megathread Update: Resources  discussion  and your questions,"# Overview

Several months ago  we posted a [megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fhrfqo/coronavirus_megathread_resources_discussion_and/) with tons of information about Coronavirus related issues. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic and recent U.S. governmental actions  we are posting a second installment of this megathread. **Please keep in mind that politics and political discussions are still not allowed here.**

#August 2020 Updates

President Trump recently signed several executive orders and memorandum related to the Coronavirus pandemic. **There are still many unknowns** about the specific details of these actions  but here is a summary of what we think we know so far:

## Payroll Taxes Deferred (Updated September 2nd)

### Summary

TL;DR - Starting September 1st  some people might not have to pay Social Security taxes. It is possible or even likely that you will have to pay taxes later. It is complicated. If you get the benefit of this deferral  please set the money aside for now.

* Payroll taxes consist of two related taxes: Social Security (6.2% of wages) and Medicare (1.45% of wages). Both employees and employers pay these taxes (i.e.  for every $1 of social security taxes you pay  your employer also pays $1). Only the Social Security portion of payroll taxes may be deferred right now  not Medicare. 

* The Secretary of the Treasury has been [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/) to **defer** the collection of Social Security taxes on those making a gross income of less than $104 000 / year ($4 000 or less per bi-weekly paycheck) starting September 1.

* Implementing seems to be optional by employers and many employers have decided to not implement this.

* While there is some possibility that this **deferral** of payroll taxes may become **forgiveness**  this has not yet occurred and the general consensus is that forgiveness would require Congress to pass new legislation which does not seem likely right now.

* The IRS has issued [Notice 2020-65](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-20-65.pdf) indicating that taxes deferred must be withheld and paid between January 1  2021 and April 30  2021  or interest and penalties will start accruing on May 1  2021.

* Finally  it is possible that we will see this action challenged through the court system and it is possible that injunctions or other court actions may impact this order.

### FAQ

* **Q** How much should I save from my check so that I can pay back the money if/when the deferral expires?

* **A** You should save approximately 6.2% of your **gross** income. Look at your paycheck; it should tell you what your gross income is (before taxes  etc...). If you really can't figure out your gross income for some reason  try setting aside 10-15% of your take home pay. We had to make a lot of simplifying assumptions to get to this number  and basing it on your gross income is absolutely more accurate  but 10-15% of take home should be reasonably close for many people.

* **Q** Can I opt out of this and continue to pay social security taxes as normal?

* **A** No. There is no provision for individuals to opt in or out of this action. You may want to ask your employer about whether they plan to implement this.

* **Q** I make close to the $104 000 limit. Can I increase 401(k) contributions  etc. to make myself qualify?

* **A** Yes. The limit is based on gross taxable income. 

* **Q** So if I make $104 001 am I out of luck?

* **A** As currently written  yes. The literal text does not include a ""phase out"" range. We would certainly suggest waiting for more clarification before voluntarily taking a pay cut.

* **Q** I was laid off for part of the year. My bi-weekly paycheck is over $4 000 but I will make under $104 000 for the full year. Do I qualify?

* **A** No. If you have over $4 000 gross income per bi-weekly paycheck  you are not eligible for the tax deferral  regardless of what your other bi-weekly paycheck amounts are. Eligibility is determined on a bi-weekly pay period basis.

* **Q** I'm not paid bi-weekly. What is the equivalent limit for me?

* **A** For someone paid bi-monthly (twice a month  24 checks a year)  the equivalent limit is $4 333.33 / check. For someone paid weekly  the equivalent limit is $2 000 / check. For someone paid monthly  the equivalent limit is $8 666.67.

* **Q** When will I have to pay the deferred taxes back?

* **A** Your employer must withhold the deferred amount between January 1  2021 and April 31  2021. 

* **Q** I'm self-employed/own a small business. Are both halves of payroll taxes deferred or only the employee half?

* **A** It appears that only the employee half may be deferred. If you are self-employed and pay your payroll taxes on your individual income tax return  this deferral doesn't impact you although possible forgiveness might.

* **Q** I work multiple jobs. Collectively  I would be above the $4 000/bi-weekly cap but on an individual job basis I am below it. Do I qualify?

* **A** Probably so. As written  the memorandum appears to be based on your paycheck per employer.

## Student Loan Interest Waiver

### Summary

TL;DR - federal student loan payments are now suspended until December 31.

The previously announced suspension on student loan payments has been [extended](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/) from September 30th until December 31. Of the four actions announced  this appears to be the most straightforward. Basically  the benefits for student loans currently in place now end December 31  not September 30.

### FAQ

* **Q** Does this apply to private loans?

* **A** No  this only applies to public loans. However  private student loan companies may have their own relief programs. If you need or want relief  contact them and ask them about what they offer.""

## Relief for Homeowners and Renters

### Summary

Tl;DR - This one doesn't include specific policies so not much is known about where this will head until federal agencies respond.

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) requires certain federal agencies to take steps to limit foreclosures or evictions. It does not include a list of specific actions or policies.

### FAQ

* **Q** So what does this mean? Can I be kicked out of my house/evicted from my apartment if I don't pay my mortgage/rent?

* **A** We don't know yet. If you are facing financial hardship  you should contact your landlord or mortgage servicer to discuss your options. Unfortunately there are no details available for us to analyze.

## Unemployment Benefit Extension (Updated September 2nd)

### Summary

TL;DR - Some people can get an extra $300/week from unemployment. But expect this to take time. The details on this one are beyond complicated.

To start  here is a [link](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/) to the text of the executive order. It establishes a $400/week benefit ($300/week from the federal government with $100/week match from the states  which can include existing payment) for unemployed individuals. Unlike the previous program  which had a fixed end date  this program is designed to run until its funding is exhausted or December 6  2020  whichever occurs first. While this program could provide a maximum of $400/week in additional benefits  given that states can ""offset"" their $100/week with existing benefits  the practical answer for many people is that this will be an extra $300/week.

### FAQ

* **Q** When will I start receiving these payments?

* **A** We don't know yet  but we would anticipate that it will be at least several more weeks. This program is different from the previous program and requires a high level of coordination with states.

* **Q** What if my state doesn't contribute an extra $100/week for its share of the payment?

* **A** You should be fine as long as you get at least $100/week currently. States are encourage to contribute an extra $100/week; however  they are allowed to use existing benefits.

* **Q** So is the benefit amount $400/week or $300/week?

* **A** This will vary by state. The executive order basically encourages states to add an additional $100/week to the federal $300/week  but they don't have to do this. This is new  but anecdotal reports from states seem to indicate that this will be $300/week for most people.

* **Q** Do I automatically qualify if I received the $600/week additional payment?

* **A** No. You must get at least $100/week from unemployment compensation  and be unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",PersonalFinanceMods,08-13-2020,False,1599103340.0,False,False,False,281,0,0,,112,0

/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,To those of you stuck on car leases that want or need an out  you may be in luck. Here’s how I did it.,"A little back-story: Both my wife and I drive 2018 Jeep Compass’. Both leased. Hers is $321 a month with 11 payments left and mine is $272 with 10 payments left.  

She hasn’t been working since last October as she gave birth in November and went straight from Maternity Leave into “COVID leave.” I just recently lost my job  so the obvious choice was to get rid of at least one vehicle  even if we had to pay down the potential negative equity.

So  I started looking at my options  and it turns out the user car market is so hot right now  I was able to get out of my lease with about $1000 in POSITIVE equity by selling to Carvana. Now granted  my car has the mileage of a one year old car and is basically in mint condition  but the point here is that Carvana is seemingly willing to pay a premium for used vehicles due to the current demand  because a lease with positive equity is virtually unheard of.

Part of what makes this possible is that Carvana uses the DEALER Lease Payoff quote as the amount that you owe  rather than the customer payoff. I was surprised by this  as they could easily pocket the difference (and I wouldn’t even mind  would end up with only about $200 of negative equity).

I don’t have time to share all my numbers but I wanted to post this in case someone hadn’t considered selling their lease to Carvana.

It may be a good idea to look into this even if you haven’t thought about or have the need to get out of your lease. You may be pleasantly surprised.",drendon6891,09-06-2020,False,False,False,False,False,580,2,2,,3110,0
/r/personalfinance/,personalfinance,Need advice: Parents want to use my credit to lease a car?,"Hi everyone  

I (21) am looking to get advice and see if there are any potential downsides or things for me to be aware of in my situation  since I'm relatively inexperienced with this kind of thing. 

My parents are currently looking to lease a car  and unfortunately their credit scores are not good  so they are asking if they can use my credit/have me as the signer and them as a co-signer  since they say the interest rates will be lower. They said they'd get 8-10%  but with my credit  they could probably get a 2-3% rate  and as a student could possibly get a discount. I have really only paid for groceries and gas with credit  and I always pay it immediately  so my credit is fine

They should be able to make consistent payments on the car. I'm just not sure if this could potentially have any repercussions on me  or if there's anything I should be aware of if I were to sign?

Edit: Thank you everyone that posted! After hearing literally everyone say not to do it  I will definitely NOT be signing for them and it almost seems silly that I even considered it! You guys are all awesome for your advice!",CarpeDM28,09-06-2020,False,1599330166.0,False,False,False,306,0,0,,492,0

Some of it is easy to understand  we need to find jobs willing to sponsor visa's for us in a nation we want to live in. I get that much. When it comes to finances though I'm not sure what should be expected. All of our debt is in USD (student loans mostly) do we just pay an exchange fee on that? I know US expats are expected to pay US income tax but I don't know how that gets reported/works.

I'm sure there are other things I'm completely oblivious to so I'm hoping some of you can share some insight.

He has a friend that runs a chemical company (we will call him Johnny) Johnny is supposedly a multimillionaire and they have known each other for a long time. ( side note I googled Johnnys house and it’s worth (200k- doesn’t seem like a millionaire to me) 

Johnny is telling Kevin that he has 6 million dollars for him- and Kevin’s job is to recruit business to buy Johnnys stock of medical gloves  Kevin has agreed. Kevin has signed a forum saying he will pay the taxes on the 6 million dollars. I have never heard of someone paying taxes on money before they have received it. secondly  now Kevin is being asked by Johnny to create a business (in my head this sounds like concealing the origins of money aka laundering) because he was already promised 6 dollars before generating this money at all.

After paying fees for a whole school year  I'll have about $200 in my account based on my current salary. Should I save up more? What is the minimum I should save up?

Ex) I should aim to always have $X minimum and feel free to spend the extra if I wish.

My current hours aren't too bad so I can pick up more hours no problem if I should aim to save higher. I just have no gauge for how much I can spend. Life is uncertain for college students so I want to make sure I have at least something in the bank.

I had $30 in the account all summer and i couldn't spend it since that was the minimum to keep the bank account open without having to pay a fee. Id hate for something to happen and have to go down that low ever again.

/r/creepy/,creepy,Introducing Community Awards to r/Creepy!,"Hello r/Creepy!  


We're super excited to announce that we have been chosen for testing the new Community Awards feature!   


* **So what exactly** ***are*** **community awards?**

[Community Awards](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/what-are-awards) are awards specific to each subreddit  that are awardable via Reddit coins. They're available in the official web UI (This includes both old reddit  and new reddit)  and the official Reddit apps.

* **What's the difference between Community Awards and the normal Silver  Gold and Platinum?**

Pretty much the main difference is the fact that you get no benefits from community awards  other than the actual award on your post. You do not receive any benefits (something i personally hope they add are benefits) from being given community awards  so you do not receive Premium nor any coins. The main point of awards is to give the receiving user a sense of pride and accomplishment. You can donate either anonymously or from your username  and can optionally add a private message 

* **Well  what are these awards?**

First off  the mods here at r/Creepy ARE NOT graphic designers  so we didn't create any custom to this subreddit. We know it may be upsetting to some of you  but let's face it - do you really want some crappy stick man as an award? Nope. So  we are using 3 of the default award designs (**If you are willing to contribute  and make a custom design for an award  feel free to!)**. As follows:

&#x200B;

**1. Certified Creepy (Pitchfork) Award (300 Coins)**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-----

# Moderator Exclusive Award(s):

There is also a Moderator exclusive award. Moderators accumulate 20% of coins spent on Community Awards in this subreddit  which in turn  we can use to give out Moderator Exclusive awards! **WHICH DO ACTUALLY HAVE A BENEFIT (THAT BENEFIT BEING PREMIUM).** So  basically  the more you users award posts with community awards - the more the moderators can award high-quality posts  with actual benefits.

/r/TwoXChromosomes/,TwoXChromosomes,[UPDATE]: Should I (25F) be concerned about my male neighbor  or am I being paranoid?,"Hi! I wanted to update anyone who read the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ijck9h/should_i_25f_be_concerned_about_my_male_neighbor/) and is wondering how I'm doing.

I appreciate everyone's concerns... I didn't expect so many responses offering their recommendations and support.

I've updated my security measures  which I should have done when I first moved in anyways. I only let the cats roam around the patio during the day when I am hanging out in the living room and can supervise (maybe 2-3 hours/ day). I haven't seen this person nor the dog since my last interaction. I did hear a woman's voice yelling out the dog's name the other day  but this could be his partner  roommate  friend  etc. I'm not sure. I will update if there are any future interactions with this person  but so far none! And let's hope it stays this way!

Nonetheless  I am safe. Thank you <3 Please stay safe also! :)

I was actually planning an escape before lockdown but unfortunately it put my plan on hold. My parents are abusive so they weren't an option and he's isolated me from any friends. 

Recently he's been contacted by his employer and it sounds like he'll be going back into work again soon  so my plan is back on.

What are women's shelters like? At any rate I'm sure it will be better than here but at the same time I tend to do bad with big changes  so maybe if I know what it will be like ahead of time it will make it feel less scary.

I have to start my real life  I went straight from my abusive parents home into his arms. It's been a few years and I'm realising that it's really not normal to deal with this and that if I walk out that door I never have to deal with violent people again...and that feels liberating. I could have a good life  a safe  happy life.

I should’ve personally shit myself and smeared it all over my body to deter a random man from sleeping in my bed. Or had pepper spray  just ready to go. Or had a deadbolt on my door. 

Because you never know when a man will push open your door even though you locked it and put a bag against it and try to sleep with you. It’s your fault for ever letting your guard down. I should be ashamed of myself for ever trying to sleep undisturbed in my own bed.

/r/TwoXChromosomes/,TwoXChromosomes,I had to tell a man no fourteen times today,"I’m sure every woman on this sub has a story to match mine but it was so frustrating I need to vent for a moment. I was on my way to reconnect with an old friend group  I decided to substitute a bus route with a walk due to covid and the fact that it was nice weather  out. I was wearing (not that it should even matter) jeans and a nice top with a bit of cleavage. A man approaches me as I’m walking and he asks me my name  I have to stop and take my headphones out because I thought he was asking for directions. After realising that he was trying to hit on me I tried to walk away and he started walking along side me  continuing to try and talk to me. Lately I’ve developed more confidence for these situations so I asked him how old he was  he laughed kind of nervously and said ‘why does it matter’. 

I said to him ‘I just want to know’ and he said ‘I’m 29.’ I smiled politely and said ‘well I’m 17 so it was nice talking to you but goodbye.’ I’m not actually 17  I’m in my early 20’s but I wasn’t wearing any makeup and figured it would get him to go away. It did not. He laughed and said ok and I insisted that it was over a ten year age gap so he should stop and he said how gorgeous I looked before directly gesturing to my chest. I told him he was being weird and kept repeating that I was seventeen. I even said ‘it would be illegal’ and ‘I really want to be left alone.’ I repeated the fact that I was seventeen 12 times and said ‘I don’t want to talk to you’ twice among with various other lines.

He left after the fourteenth time having crossed the road to follow me after I tried to get away. It wasn’t that bad I guess I’m just annoyed that it took so long for him to leave me alone and that despite him harassing me I was still relatively polite the entire time.

Edit: I made this post when I was tired and frustrated last night and woke up today with so much support so thank you to this sub for pulling through yet again. To the people telling me to next time start shouting and making a scene or being rude to him I was raised in a traditional household and my gut instinct is to be polite. Of course I appreciate the advice but it can be really hard to override the instinct to just grin and bear it  for me even just saying ‘you’re being weird’ and ‘it’s illegal’ is more than I ever could in the past.

/r/TwoXChromosomes/,TwoXChromosomes,Women's voice vs Men's voice,"Forgive me  using mobile 

So I'm (22F) and my partner (22M) are currently in government mandated quarantine in Australia after finally returning from Japan after 11 cancelled flights. It's been a journey 
I'll be here for fourteen days total and I'm currently on my 7th day.

On the second day everyone is tested for covid. All negative 

Late on that second day I got a bit of a sore throat  but I just assumed I must've nicked it while eating or something  no big deal. Either way  I did call up and let them know  cause it could be something more. The nurse told me she'll arrange for me to get tested again tomorrow. 

The pain was pretty bad  but nothing some honey and lemon or salt gargle couldn't sooth. So while I was on the phone  I asked for some lemon and honey  maybe even a throat lozenge. But no  I would have to order some in to the hotel. 

So I said my thanks and ordered some medicine that night  despite having little to no money after paying for 11 flights and living off my saving for 7 months.

On the second day  they called to check in (it's a daily thing) and ask if I have any symptoms. I told her that I called last night about a sore throat and it's gotten worse. She says something along the lines of  ""are you sure? I don't see that here  but I'll double check. And she hangs up. 

Later that day two nurses knock on our door to do the second test. Mind you  the first nurse was rude and rough with the test  so I wasn't looking forward to it. But this nurse was lovely  and even gave my throat a look after I asked her to check. She said she noted swelling  redness and ulcer on the left side and told me she'll make note and tell the on site doctor. 
Nothing eventuates from that.

So I'm still in pain  it's hard to talk and swallow. And my medicine is far off  cause of all the delays. So I call the nurses again to ask if I could have a throat lozenge  or some lemon and honey. The answer was again no  and she told me to wait till my medicine arrived. I kind of assumed that I'd be able to get medicine or medical assistance  since there are medical staff here and they expect people are sick. 

In the evening I still can't really talk and the pain is getting worse. My partner decided to call on my behalf to ask for some help. He called and said ""my partner has a sore throat  can we get some honey and lemon or salt to gargle?""
And they go ""sure  and we'll give you some fresh lemon as well""

I couldn't believe what I just heard. I was bubbling. Literally only took him 10 seconds. It was so easy for him to be listened to and get what he required.

An hour later  there's a knock at the door and a little bag with half a sliced lemon  honey  and lemongrass and ginger teabags was placed at the door.

My partner kind of understood why I was so mad  but not to the full extent. Cause he's never had an experience like this. But I just need to get it out there. Thank you for reading
